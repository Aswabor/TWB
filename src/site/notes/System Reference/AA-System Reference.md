Some special abilities and environmental hazards, such as starvation and the long-term effects offreezing or scorching temperatures, can lead to a special condition called exhaustion. Exhaustion is measured in six levels. An effect can give a creature one or more levels ofexhaustion, as specified in the effect's description.

| Level | Effect                                                                    |
| ----- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| 1     | Disadvantage on ability checks                                            |
| 2     | Speed halved                                                              |
| 3     | Disadvantage on attack rolls and saving throws 4 Hit point maximum halved |
| 5     | Speed reduced to 0                                                        |

If an already exhausted creature suffers another effect that causes exhaustion, its current level ofexhaustion increases by the amount specified in the effect's description.

A creature suffers the effect of its current level ofexhaustion as well as all lower levels. For example, a creature suffering level 2 exhaustion has its speed halved and has disadvantage on ability checks.

An effect that removes exhaustion reduces its level as specified in the effect's description, with all exhaustion effects ending ifa creature's exhaustion level is reduced below l .

### Jumping
Your Strength determines how far you can jump.

#### Long Jump
When you make a Long Jump, you cover a number of feet up to your **Strength score** if you move at least **10 feet** on foot immediately before the jump. When you make a **standing Long Jump**, you can leap only **half that distance**. Either way, **each foot** you clear on the jump **costs a foot of Movement**.
This rule assumes that the height of your jump doesn’t matter, such as a jump across a stream or chasm. At your GM’s option, you must succeed on a DC 10 Strength (Athletics) check to clear a low obstacle (no taller than a quarter of the jump’s distance), such as a hedge or low wall. Otherwise, you hit it.
When you land in Difficult Terrain, you must succeed on a DC 10 Dexterity (Acrobatics) check to land on your feet. Otherwise, you land prone.

#### High Jump
When you make a High Jump, you leap into the air a number of feet equal to **3 + your Strength modifier** if you move at least 10 feet on foot immediately before the jump. When you make a standing High Jump, you can jump only half that distance. Either way, each foot you clear on the jump costs a foot of Movement. In some circumstances, your GM might allow you to make a Strength (Athletics) check to jump higher than you normally can.

You can extend your arms half your height above yourself during the jump. Thus, you can reach above you a distance equal to the height of the jump plus 1½ times your height.

### Stationary
A Stationary object is big enough or important enough to get its own encounter map (DM call). Any spell is allways relative to the refrence frame of the surfece of the target.

# Weapon Properties
## #W-Property/Ammunition
You can use a weapon that has the ammunition property to make a ranged attack only if you have ammunition to fire from the weapon. Each time you attack with the weapon, you expend one piece of ammunition. Drawing the ammunition from a quiver, case, or other container is part of the attack (you need a free hand to load a one-handed weapon). At the end of the battle, you can recover half your expended ammunition by taking a minute to search the battlefield. If you use a weapon that has the ammunition property to make a melee attack, you treat the weapon as an improvised weapon (see "Improvised Weapons" later in the section). A sling must be loaded to deal any damage when used in this way.

---
## #W-Property/Armor-Piercing
An armor-piercing weapon is a melee weapon designed to punch through armor and thick hide alike. When you make an attack roll using an armor-piercing weapon, you gain a +1 bonus to the attack roll if your target is wearing armor or has natural armor.

---
## #W-Property/Blackpowder
Blackpowder weapons fire projectiles with ear-splitting noise, shredding armour with deadly force. When fired, Blackpowder weapons emit a deafening crack audible 300 feet away. Unfortunately, Blackpowder weapons often become useless when wet. If a Blackpowder weapon is exposed to heavy rain, submerged, or drenched in water by a similar means, then it cannot fire. A character cannot use this weapon again until they complete a short rest in dry conditions.

---
## #W-Property/Brutal
Brutal weapons are designed to subject an adversary to the most harm. When you score a critical hit against a creature with a Brutal weapon, you can add an additional weapon damage die to the damage dealt.

---
## #W-Property/Cumbersome
Cumbersome weapons are difficult to wield but are effective tools for those strong enough to wield them. When making an attack with a Cumbersome weapon, you must use your Strength modifier for both the attack and damage rolls.

---
## #W-Property/Damage
An advanced weapon that has the damage property can deal an alternative form of damage. You can choose the type when you attack or when you hit with an attack from any of the damage types mentioned.

---
## #W-Property/Defending
A defending weapon is either made for parrying, has advanced techniques for use in parrying, or both. When you use a defending weapon, you can use your reaction to defend against a melee weapon attack that hits you. If you do, increase your AC by 1d4 against that attack.

---
## #W-Property/Disarming
A disarming weapon can catch a foe’s weapon, allowing you to remove it from their grasp. When an opponent misses you with a melee weapon attack, you can use your reaction to attempt to disarm them. Both you and the attacker must make contested attack rolls. If you roll higher, and the weapon is something the target can drop, the weapon falls from the target’s grasp, landing within 5 feet of the target in a space you choose. If you score a critical hit, and the attacker did not, you can send the weapon flying up to 15 feet away from the target into a space you choose instead. If you have a free hand when you score a critical hit this way, you can disarm the target so that you end up with the dropped weapon in your hand. If the attacker tied or rolled higher, then nothing happens.

---
## #W-Property/Double
A two-handed, double weapon functions as two light weapons, one in each hand, for two-weapon fighting purposes. If a double weapon has the reach property, you can use only one of these properties during the same turn.

---
## #W-Property/Entangling
An entangling weapon can tie a target up. When you hit with an entangling weapon attack against a target no more than one size larger than you, you can use your bonus action to attempt to grapple the target. (This bonus-action use applies when you throw an entangling weapon because you’re throwing with special preparation.) You don’t need a free hand—the weapon fulfills that requirement. If you succeed, the target is grappled by you or the weapon if you’re no longer holding it. Until the grapple ends, you can’t use the entangling weapon to attack a different target. If you aren’t holding the entangling weapon, such as when you throw a gladiator net, the grapple continues, and the target needs to succeed at a DC 10 Dexterity (Acrobatics) or Strength (Athletics) check to escape the weapon.

---
## #W-Property/Finesse
When making an attack with a finesse weapon, you use your choice of your Strength or Dexterity modifier for the attack and damage rolls. You must use the same modifier for both rolls.

---
## #W-Property/Guard
Guard weapons are made to fight defensively, often designed with a long reach or flat surface for parrying. While wielding a Guard weapon, whenever a hostile creature moves within your reach, and you did not move on your last turn, you can use a reaction to make a weapon attack with a Guard weapon against that creature. If the attack hits, then it deals no damage, the creature immediately stops and its speed becomes 0 until the end of its turn.

---
## #W-Property/Hafted
A hafted weapon’s haft can function well as an off-hand attack. When you attack with only the hafted weapon, you can use a bonus action to make a melee weapon attack with the haft. The haft deals 1d4 bludgeoning damage, and you add your ability modifier to damage as you would for other sorts of two-weapon fighting. If you have feats that mimic this ability, the damage dice becomes 1d8 instead.

---
## #W-Property/Heavy
Small creatures have disadvantage on attack rolls with heavy weapons. A heavy weapon's size and bulk make it too large for a Small creature to use effectively.

---
## #W-Property/Light
A light weapon is small and easy to handle, making it ideal for use when fighting with two weapons. See the rules for two-weapon fighting in chapter 9.

---
## #W-Property/Loading
Because of the time required to load this weapon, you can fire only one piece of ammunition from it when you use an action, bonus action, or reaction to fire it, regardless of the number of attacks you can normally make.

---
## #W-Property/Magazine
A weapon with the magazine property also has a number and an ammunition type. The weapon holds that amount and type of ammo, which you can expend before needing to reload the weapon. Removing or loading a magazine counts as your interaction with an object, so doing both in one turn takes an action. A magazine weapon comes with one empty magazine included in the weapon’s cost and weight. Loading an empty magazine with ammunition takes 1 minute.

---
## #W-Property/Momentum
Momentum weapons are designed to deliver devastating attacks as part of a charge. When you hit a creature with a Momentum weapon, and you have moved 20 feet or more in a straight line this turn, you can upgrade the damage dice to the weapon’s momentum dice value.

---
## #W-Property/Monk
A monk gains proficiency with advanced monk weapons at 5th level.

---
## #W-Property/Precise
When you attack with a precise weapon, you can score a critical hit on a roll of 19 or 20. If a feature or item you have increases the numbers you can roll for a critical hit, a precise weapon increases that range by one. A fighter with Superior Critical, for instance, scores a critical hit on a roll of 17 to 20 with a precise weapon. Any roll lower than 20 must still hit to be a critical hit—it’s not an automatic hit as if the roll was a 20.

---
## #W-Property/Range
A weapon that can be used to make a ranged attack has a range in parentheses after the ammunition or thrown property. The range lists two numbers. The first is the weapon's normal range in feet, and the second indicates the weapon's long range. When attacking a target beyond normal range, you have disadvantage on the attack roll. You can't attack a target beyond the weapon's long range.

---
## #W-Property/Reach
This weapon adds 5 feet to your reach when you attack with it, as well as when determining your reach for opportunity attacks with it. If a reach weapon has the double property, you can use only one of these properties during the same turn.

---
## #W-Property/Repeater
Repeater weapons fire rounds in quick succession, either using multiple barrels or quick reloading mechanisms. When you take the attack action with a Repeater weapon, you can use a bonus action to attack again with the same weapon. You don’t add your ability modifier to the damage of the second shot, unless that modifier is negative. You can make this bonus action even if the weapon has the Loading property.

---
## #W-Property/Restraining
Only entangling weapons can be restraining weapons. If you have a target grappled with a restraining weapon, and you succeed on another attempt to grapple the target with the same weapon, the target becomes restrained instead of grappled. The target then remains restrained until the grapple ends. If you stop holding the restraining weapon, the target can escape as if from an unheld entangling weapon.

---
## #W-Property/Returning
A returning weapon allows you to hurl the weapon in such a way that it returns to you. When you attack with a returning weapon, if you roll an even number on the d20, the weapon returns to you by the end of your turn. You can catch the weapon if you have a hand free to do so. If not, the weapon lands at a random point within 5 feet of you. If you roll an odd number on the d20 for the attack roll, the weapon fails to return to you.

---
## #W-Property/Scatter
Scatter weapons are capable of devastating multiple enemies at once. When you take the attack action and successfully hit a creature with a Scatter weapon, measure the weapon’s Scatter range from the square (or point of impact) that the target you hit occupies. All creatures other than the original target that fall within the weapon’s scatter range must make a Dexterity saving throw against your Scatter DC. Upon a failed save, they take damage equal to the ability score modifier you used to hit with the weapon (minimum of 1). Damage dealt this way is the same type as the weapon that you hit with.

>Scatter Save DC = 8 + your proficiency bonus + the ability score modifier that you use to determine damage for this weapon.
 
A weapon’s Scatter range and shape are mentioned in its statistics. For example, a Flame Bellows has a range of 15 feet and a Scatter range of 15 feet. This means the weapon can hit a target within 15 feet, and upon a hit, a 15-foot cone extending beyond the target will determine those hit by the Scatter effect, up to a total distance of 30 feet.

---
## #W-Property/Set
You can use a bonus action on your turn to prepare, or “set,” a set weapon against a foe moving toward you. A weapon becomes unset if you move or take any action after setting it. If a target enters your reach while you have the weapon set, you can use your reaction to make a melee attack with the set weapon against that target. If you hit, and your target moved 20 feet or more toward you before the attack, you can roll one of the weapon’s damage dice one additional time and add it to the damage total.

---
## #W-Property/Silvered
Some monsters that have immunity or resistanceto nonmagical weapons are susceptible to silver weapons, so cautious adventurers invest extra coin to plate their weapons with silver. You can silver a single weapon or ten pieces of ammunition for 100 gp. This cost represents not only the price of the silver, but the time and expertise needed to add silver to the weapon without making it less effective.

---
## #W-Property/Special
A weapon with the special property has unusual rules governing its use, explained in the weapon's description 
> Lance. You have disadvantage when you use a lance to attack a target within 5 feet of you. Also, a lance requires two hands to wield when you aren't mounted.

>Net. A Large or smaller creature hit by a net is restrained until it is freed. A net has no effect on creatures that are formless, or creatures that are Huge or larger. A creature can use its action to make a DC 10 Strength check, freeing itself or another creature within its reach on a success. Dealing 5 slashing damage to the net (AC 10) also frees the creature without harming it, ending the effect and destroying the net. When you use an action, bonus action, or reaction to attack with a net, you can make only one attack regardless of the number of attacks you can normally make.

---
## #W-Property/Strong-Draw
An advanced ranged weapon with the strong-draw quality requires great strength to use. You must have a Strength of 13 or higher to use such a weapon, or you make attack rolls using the weapon with disadvantage. You add not only your Dexterity modifier to damage with a strong-draw weapon, but you also add 1 + half your Strength Modifier (rounded down) to the damage.

---
## #W-Property/Swift
Swift weapons are renowned for their utility in recovering from missed attacks. When you miss an attack with a Swift weapon, you gain advantage on the next attack roll you make with that weapon against the same target.

---
## #W-Property/Thrown
If a weapon has the thrown property, you can throw the weapon to make a ranged attack. If the weapon is a melee weapon, you use the same ability modifier for that attack roll and damage roll that you would use for a melee attack with the weapon. For example, if you throw a hand axe, you use your Strength, but if you throw a dagger, you can use either your Strength or your Dexterity, since the dagger has the finesse property.

---
## #W-Property/Tripping 
A tripping weapon allows users to knock targets prone. When you hit with a tripping weapon, you can use a bonus action to force your target to attempt a Strength saving throw, provided the target is no more than one size larger than you. The DC for the saving throw equals 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Strength or Dexterity modifier (your choice). If the target fails, it falls prone.

---
## #W-Property/Two-Handed
This weapon requires two hands when you attack with it.

---
## #W-Property/Versatile
This weapon can be used with one or two hands. A damage value in parentheses appears with the property-the damage when the weapon is used with two hands to make a melee attack.

---
# Ammunition Properties
## Advanced ammunition
### Damage Types
Advanced ammunition named after a damage type deals that damage type. Arrows and bolts can have wide, slashing heads or heavy, bludgeoning tips. A sling bullet can have piercing facets. All such ammo is heavier than normal, so the weapon’s maximum range using it is half normal.

---
### Ranging
Ammunition that has the ranging property is lighter and better made than common counterparts. When you fire ranging ammo, you can increase your weapon’s normal range by 50 percent.

---
### Whistling
Ammunition with the whistling property creates a high-pitched sound after firing. This sound is audible for 300 feet from the ammo as it flies. Whistling ammo isn’t heavier, but it catches the air in baffles to create its sound, so its maximum range is half normal. Whistling ammo deals bludgeoning damage.

## Alchemical Advanced Ammunition
Alchemical ammunition carries an alchemical payload. Rather than hurling a vial as an improvised weapon, you fire alchemical ammunition from a projectile weapon, using your normal attack bonus with that weapon. Alchemical ammunition deals the ammo’s normal damage type in addition to delivering the alchemical effect. This ammo is heavy though, so a weapon’s maximum range using al- chemical ammo is half normal. The alchemical ammunition is destroyed once used, whether the attack hits or misses.

### Acid, Alchemist’s Fire, and Holy Water
Other than how you hit a creature using alchemical ammo, these substances have their normal effects.

### War-Oil
When you fire war-oil ammo at an area and hit AC 10, viscous oil covers the area within 5 feet of a point you target. If you target a creature, you must hit that creature’s AC to cover the creature in war oil. But if you hit the creature or AC 10, you can pick a point in or adjacent to that creature’s space to determine the war oil’s area as if you targeted a point.
War oil’s area is difficult terrain. A creature standing in the area when it appears, that starts its turn in the area, or that enters the area for the first time on a turn must succeed at a DC 13 Dexterity saving throw or fall prone.
War oil is also flammable. If lit, such as by dealing fire damage to a creature covered in the oil, the oil burns for 2 rounds. Burning war oil deals 2d4 fire damage to any creature ignited in this way. An ignited creature can douse the flames by using its action to make a DC 10 Dexterity saving throw to extinguish the flames. If the creature ends its turn still aflame, the creature takes 2d4 fire damage. If war oil ignites in an area, a creature takes fire 1d4 damage when it enters the area for the first time on its turn or starts its turn in that area. A creature can take fire damage from war oil only once per round.
>War oil dries and ceases to be slippery or flammable after 1 minute.

## Specialised Ammunition
>Specialised ammunition can have one weapon property with (A) next to its name. This property is applied when the ammunition is purchased or crafted, and cannot be changed.

### Armour Piercing (A)
When you roll to hit a creature with an Armour Piercing weapon or ammunition, if the target is wearing heavy armour or natural armour that exceeds 17, then you receive +2 on your attack roll to hit that target.

### Blessed (A)
When a creature that is a fiend, fey, or undead is hit with a Blessed weapon or ammunition, that creature’s speed is reduced  by 10 feet until the end of their next turn. Additionally, they cannot take reactions until the end of their next turn.

### Brutal (A)

# EC-AC System  
## Evasion Class (EC)
Your EC is determined by the type of armor you are wearing - or not wearing (in the case of Unarmored). Consult the Evasion Class Table below to determine your EC.

| Evasion Class table       |                      |
| ------------------------- | -------------------- |
| Unarmored and Light Armor | 10 + Dex Mod         |
| Medium Armor              | 10 + Dex Mod (Max 2) |
| Heavy Armor               | 10                   |

 Anytime a shield grants AC, it also increases your EC by the same amount. This is one way for characters that aren't as nimble to still be able to increase their EC.

---
## Armor Class (AC)
Your Armor Class (AC) represents how well your character avoids being wounded in battle. Things that contribute to your AC include the armor you wear, the shield you carry, and your Dexterity modifier. Not all characters wear armor or carry shields, however. Without armor or a shield, your character's AC equals 10 + his or her Dexterity modifier. If your character wears armor, carries a shield, or both calculate your AC based on those factors.

---
## Armor Reduction (AR)
When you are hit by an attack that falls within your EC-AC range, you reduce the damage of the attack by an amount equal to your AR value. This represents being partially hit by an attack, failing to evade the attack completely, but also mitigating some of the impact. Regardless of the attack's damage type, you have found a way to avoid some of its damage and it becomes reduced by your AR value.
>Armor Reduction Value: (AC - 10)

---
## How it Works
In order to better differentiate the different armor options, we've added two new defensive statistics called [[EC-AC System#Evasion Class EC|Evasion Class (EC)]] and [[EC-AC System#Armor Reduction AR|Armor Reduction (AR)]] that work alongside the existing [[EC-AC System#Armor Class AC|Armor Class (AC)]]. Your EC and AC will often be referred to as your EC-AC range that's represented by a couple of numbers. For example, when wearing Plate armor your EC is 10 and your AC is 18, which will be represented as 10-18 and referred to as your EC-AC range.

>When an attack made against you is:
>- above your AC, you are hit and take full damage.
>- below your EC, you evade the hit and take no damage.
>- within your EC-AC range, you are hit but take reduced damage as determined by your AR value.

 

# Getting Into And Out Of Armor
The time i t takes to don o r doff a type o f armor o r a shield is shown in the Donning and Doffing Armor table.

**Don.** This is the time it takes to put on the item. You benefit from its AC only if you take the full time to don it.

**Doff.** This is the time it takes to take off the item. If you have help removing armor, reduce the time by half.

## Donning And Doffing Armor
| Category     | Don        | Doff      |
| ------------ | ---------- | --------- |
| Light Armor  | 1 minute   | 1 minute  |
| Medium Armor | 5 minutes  | 1 minute  |
| Heavy Armor  | 10 minutes | 5 minutes | 
| Shield       | 1 action   | 1 action  |

<div class="markdown-embed-title">



</div>


```toc

``` 
# Special Materials
## Metal
Armor, shields, and weapons are most commonly crafted out of various types of common or precious metals. Steel, bronze, and iron are commonplace, but some smiths forge rare items out of these rare materials.

### Adamantine
Adamantine is one of the hardest substances in existence. It’s an ultrahard metal found in meteorites and extraordinary mineral veins.

**Weapon:** Melee weapons and ammunition made from or coated with adamantine are unusually effective when used to break objects. Whenever an adamantine weapon or piece of ammunition hits an object, the hit is a critical hit.

**Armor & Shield:** While you're wearing armor or wielding a shield made with adamantine, any critical hit against you becomes a normal hit.

---
### Mithral
Mithral is a light, flexible metal. A mithral chain shirt or breastplate can be worn under normal clothes. Items made of mithral weigh half as much as normal.

**Weapon:** A weapon made of mithral loses the Heavy property, or gains the Light property if it does not have the Heavy property.

**Armor:** If the armor normally imposes DisADV on Stealth or Acrobatics Checks or has a Strength requirement, the mithral version of the armor doesn’t. It also removes the Bulky and Cumbersome properties.

**Shield:** All shields made from mithral have the Thrown property for 2x the distance and lose the Bulky property.

---
### Cold Iron
This iron mined deep underground, known for its effectiveness against fey creatures, is forged at a lower temperature to preserve its latent properties. Items made of cold iron cost twice as much to make as their normal counterparts.

**Weapon:** When you make a weapon attack and hit a fey creature with a weapon or piece of ammunition made from cold iron, it deals an additional die of damage and the creature is Impaired until the start of your next turn.

**Armor:** While you are wearing armor or wielding a shield made of cold iron, fey creatures have DisADV on melee attacks against you, and you have ADV on saves to resist being Charmed by them.

**Shield:** If you are the target of a Charmed or domination effect, you can use a Reaction to raise your shield and reflect the spell back (if you make the save).

---
### Lead
Lead is one of the most dense substances in existence, so much so that magic itself seems to not be able to penetrate it. There are many drawbacks to wearing lead, but also many benefits. If you are wearing or wielding Items made from Lead you cannot be the target of Divination spells.

**Weapon:** Weapons made from lead gain the Heavy property, and if it would already have that property then it’ll require a minimum Strength score of 20 to wield it. Weapon attacks with lead weapons receive a -2 to hit but gain a +2 to damage rolls.

**Armor:** Armor made from lead reduces the wearer’s movement speed by 5ft and the armor type increases by one level, ie Light becomes Medium, and Medium becomes Heavy. If the armor is already Heavy then it’ll require a minimum Strength score of 20 to wear it. While wearing lead armor your AC gains a +1 bonus and you are resistant to Psychic damage.

**Shield:** Wielding a shield made from lead results in a loss of 5ft of your movement speed in exchange for a +1 to the shield’s AC bonus. You become resistant to Lightning damage and immediately succeed on any saves against spells that deal Lightning damage.

---
### Silver

Silver is known for its potency against incorporeal and shapeshifting creatures. Silvered weapons have properties to both deal damage to these creatures and protect yourself from them.

**Weapon:** When you make a weapon attack and hit an incorporeal or shapeshifting creature with a weapon or piece of ammunition made from silver, the attack’s damage bypasses any resistances or immunities to the damage, and the target suffers an extra 1d4 damage.

**Armor:** While wearing armor made of silver, you have ADV on saves made to resist the effects from incorporeal or shapeshifting creatures.

**Shield:** You double the AC from your shield against any attacks from incorporeal or shapeshifting creatures.

---
## Wood
Wood is used to make many types of weapons. Special forms of wood can be used in place of metal or cloth. Wood items are not subject to spells and effects that target metal.

### Lightwood
Lightwood is a rare form of wood that is commonly used by druids to craft armor and weapons. This rare magic wood is as hard as normal wood but very light. Any wooden, or mostly wooden, item (such as a bow, an arrow, or a spear) made from lightwood weighs only half as much as a normal wooden item of that type.

**Weapon:** A weapon made from lightwood loses the Heavy property, or gains the Light property if it does not already have the Heavy property. The weapon breaks after you attack anything 3 times that is made of flames or that can ignite wood (such as a fire elemental).

**Armor & Shield:** If the armor normally imposes DisADV on Stealth or Acrobatics Checks or has a Strength requirement, the lightwood version of the armor doesn’t. While wearing armor or wielding a shield made from lightwood, you have resistance to Lightning damage. These items break after 3 times of taking 10 or more Fire damage in one hit. They also remove the Bulky and Cumbersome properties.

---
### Shadewood
Shadewood is harvested from forests located on the shadow plane. Its weight and texture are the same as normal wood, but its colors are grayscale with a high contrast between different shades of black and gray. There is a strange sense of altered reality when holding shadewood, as if it might be some elaborate illusion.
Armor and weapons can be made with shadewood. Such items always seem to be illuminated poorly, as if in lighting one step darker. A shadewood item is invisible in darkness, even if perceived by a creature with Darkvision or who can see in magical darkness.

**Weapon:** When you make a weapon attack using a weapon or piece of ammunition made from shadewood, you gain a +1 bonus on your attack roll if the target of your attack is in an area of dim light (+2 in darkness). The weapon breaks after 3 attacks against anything that is made of flames or that can ignite wood (such as a fire elemental).

**Armor:** While wearing armor made from shadewood, you have ADV on Stealth Checks while in areas of dim light, and you are considered Invisible while in areas of darkness. The armor breaks after 3 times of taking 10 or more Fire damage in one hit.

**Shield:** While wielding a shield made from shadewood, your AC increases by 1 while in areas of dim light (+2 in darkness). The shield breaks after 3 times of taking 10 or more Fire damage in one hit while raised (such as when using the Shield Block martial technique).

---
### Heavywood
This exceptionally hard wood is useful in the manufacture of armor and weapons. Unlike most woods, heavywood can be used instead of metal to fashion heavy armor and weapons— it is somewhat shapeable during manufacturing, and it keeps a sharp edge. Heavywood items are as durable as their steel counterparts.
 
**Weapon:** A weapon made from heavywood breaks after 3 attacks against anything that is made of flames or that can ignite wood (such as a fire elemental).

**Armor & Shield:** While wearing armor or wielding a shield made from heavywood, you have resistance to Lightning damage. The armor breaks after 3 times of taking 10 or more Fire damage in one hit.

---
## Mineral
Hardened minerals can be used in place of wood and steel. Materials like bone, horn, shell, ivory, and coral can be used. Mineral Items are not subject to spells and effects that target metal.

### Chitin (Scale, Carapace, Exoskeleton)
Chitin come from reptilian scales or the hardened outer exoskeleton of large insects. This material is light and can take all shapes and sizes depending on the bugs used to craft the gear. This material is very potent at dealing Poison damage and protecting yourself from it.

**Weapons:** When you score a critical hit with a weapon or piece of ammunition made from chitin, the target is Poisoned for 1d4 rounds. The weapon also deals an extra 1d4 damage against Poisoned targets.

**Armor:** While wearing armor made from chitin, you have resistance to Poison damage and ADV on saves made to resist being Poisoned. The armor also grants ADV on Stealth Checks made to hide while in areas of tall grass and trees, such as forests.

**Shields:** While wielding a shield made from chitin, you have resistance to Poison damage and ADV on saves made to resist being Poisoned. Whenever you suffer Poison damage while wielding a shield made from chitin, the shield absorbs some of the poison. The first time you hit a target with a melee attack made using the shield within the next minute, you deal an extra 1d6 Poison damage.

---
### Exotic bone (horn, shell, ivory)
Exotic bones come from the most dangerous of creatures and are rare materials to create weapons and armor with. It has seen use mostly by tribal folk that live outside of typical civilizations or deep within the sea.

**Weapon:** These weapons are extremely sharp and dense. You gain a +1 bonus to attack and damage rolls made using the weapon. It breaks after rolling 3 critical failures on attack rolls made with the weapon.

**Armor & Shields:** While wearing armor or wielding a shield made from exotic bone, you have resistance to Slashing and Piercing damage. The armor breaks after 3 times of taking 10 or more Bludgeoning damage in one hit.

---
### Coral
This material is made from twisted and bound together barnacles, crystallized seaweed, crab shells, and sugar-coated wood from deep below the ocean’s surface.

**Weapon:** Weapons made from coral have the Aquatic property. When you make a weapon attack using a weapon or piece of ammunition made from coral, you gain a +1 bonus on your attack and damage rolls while underwater. The weapon breaks after you attack anything 3 times that is made of lightning (such as a lightning elemental).

**Armor:** While wearing armor made from coral, you have ADV on checks made to swim, and swimming does not cost extra movement. Whenever you start your turn Unconscious while in water, the buoyancy of the armor also causes you to float 60ft to the surface. The armor breaks after 3 times of taking 10 or more Lightning damage in one hit.

**Shield:** While wielding a shield made from coral, your AC increases by 1 while underwater. While the shield is sheathed on your back, swimming does not cost extra movement unless imposed by difficult terrain. The shield breaks after 3 times of taking 10 or more Lightning damage in one hit while raised (such as when using the Shield Block martial technique).

---
### Crystal & Gemstones

This material is sculpted from mined crystals and gems with a variety of colors that can easily be enchanted to hold powerful magic. This material works very well with many types of magic, both to channel it and protect against it. Any weapon, armor, or shield made from this material can be used as a spell casting focus.

**Weapon:** Whenever you take Cold, Fire, Lightning, or Radiant damage while wielding a weapon made from this material, the weapon becomes charged with the stored energy. The first time you hit a target with a melee attack made using the weapon within the next minute, you deal an extra 1d4 damage of the triggering type. The weapon breaks after rolling 3 critical failures with it.

**Armor:** While wearing armor made from this material, you gain 1 level of Defense against spell attack rolls. The armor also grants you resistance to Radiant damage, and it breaks after 3 critical hits are scored against you while wearing it.

**Shield:** While wielding a shield made from this material, you gain 1 level of Defense against spell attack rolls. The shield breaks after 3 critical hits are scored against you while raised (such as when using the Shield Block martial technique).

---
### Obsidian
This is a different type of glass, still fragile but it has one of the sharpest edges of any material. This black obsidian glass has no magical properties but if used carefully could be very powerful.

**Weapon:** When dealing damage with a weapon made from obsidian, all damage dice is doubled. The weapon breaks when a natural 1 or natural 20 are rolled.

**Armor:** While wearing armor made from obsidian you are resistant to Necrotic, Acid, and Poison damage. The armor breaks after 3 times taking 10 damage or more from a melee attack roll, when this happens both the wearer and the attacker take 1d6 Piercing damage.

**Shield:** When wielding a shield made from obsidian and you get hit in combat by a melee attack, you can deal 1d4 Piercing damage to your attacker. The shield breaks after 3 times taking 10 damage or more from melee attack rolls.

---
### Enchanted Glass

Glass is quite fragile and sharp and rarely turned into weapons and armor due to its potential to break and its extreme value. There are endless colors of glass and you can use glassblower’s tools to craft and repair these items. Some crafters have found methods to be able to enchant the glass in such a way to reinforce the weaknesses but still maintain strong properties for magic. Any weapon, armor, or shield made from enchanted glass can be used as a spell casting focus.

**Weapon:** When you make an attack with a weapon made from enchanted glass, you have ADV on the attack if the target has cast a spell since the start of its last turn. When you hit a creature with the weapon, the target has DisADV on any saves it makes to maintain its Concentration. On a critical hit you silence the target until the end of its next turn. The weapon breaks after rolling 3 critical failures with it.

**Armor:** While wearing armor made from enchanted glass you have ADV on Spell Saves against spells that use an area of effect. When you take Fire, Lightning, Cold, or Radiant damage you become resistant to that damage type for 1 minute or until you take another source of elemental damage, then you become resistant to that new damage type. Armor made from enchanted glass breaks after 3 critical hits are scored against you while wearing it.

**Shield:** While wielding a shield made from enchanted glass you add the shields AC bonus to saves against spells that deal area of effect damage. When a spell attack targeting you is a critical failure you can reflect the spell back at the caster. Shields made from enchanted glass break after 3 critical hits are scored against you while wearing it.

## Dragon
One of the most difficult and legendary materials to obtain is that of a dragon. Items crafted from dragons make exceedingly powerful weapons and armor. These items infer some of the properties of the dragon from the latent magic within.

### Dragonhide, Dragonscale, & Dragonbone
In place of other materials dragonhide can craft Light and Medium Armor, while dragonscale can craft Medium and Heavy Armor. Neither can be used to create weapons or shields.
Dragonbone is much more durable. It can be used to create ALL types of armor, weapons and shields, but it is considered a +1 magic item along with all other properties.

**Weapon:** When you make a weapon attack using a weapon or piece of ammunition made from a dragon, you deal an extra 2d6 damage determined by the dragon’s type (see the table below).

**Armor:** While wearing armor made from a dragon, you gain damage resistance as determined by the dragon’s type (see the table below). You also gain ADV on any Intimidation Checks while wearing the armor.

**Shield:** While wielding a shield made from a dragon, you gain damage resistance as determined by the dragon’s type (see table below). Additionally, 1/  
LR you can use an action to raise
the shield and invoke fear in the hearts of your enemies. Each creature that can see the shield must make a DC (13 + prof. bonus) Wis Save. Failure: The target is Frightened of you for 1 minute, until it makes its save at the end of each turn, or takes any damage.

# Harvesting
## Monster Type/Skill Check

>The DC of the check is equal to **8 + The Harvested Creatures CR** (Treating any CR <1 as 0)

 Success on this check grants the player full knowledge of any useful harvesting materials on the creature, the DC requirement to harvest those materials, any special requirements to harvest them, and any potential risks in doing so. In addition, any harvesting check made on that creature by that player is rolled at advantage. A character may only attempt one appraisal check per creature.

# Transformations
## A Blessing or A curse?
Within the dark fantasy world of Etharis Transformations are representative of the  
gothic and body horror elements of the world.  
As a result, they should increase a character in power but ultimately be rooted in tragedy, as  
the setting demands. However, if you are not playing in a dark fantasy setting or you want your Transformation to feel more like a blessing than a curse, discuss with your GM the possibility of removing some or all the flaws associated with your Transformation. Alternatively, feel free to tinker with the boons and flaws with your GM. Transformations should suit the needs of your campaign, not the other way around.

## Leveling Up
Characters that have successfully completed  
a transformation can continue the process  
by increasing their transformation level. The character must achieve a milestone before gaining a transformation level. Each type of transformation has an example list of possible milestones that are thematically unique. Talk with your GM to come up with applicable milestones for your campaign and how you can achieve them.

When you increase your transformation level, you choose one boon from that level, or a lower level, provided you meet that boon’s prerequisites. You gain the new level’s flaw as well.

## Universal Milestones
The following milestones are examples that can apply to all (or most) transformations:
-   Undertaking an exceptionally evil (or good) act.
-   Completing an ancient ritual.
-   Obtaining a powerful artifact.
-   Being cursed by a dark agent.
-   Being exalted by a patron or god.

## Suggested Class Level to Transformation Level

| Transformation Level | Recommended Class Level Range |
| -------------------- | ----------------------------- |
| 1                    | 1-4                           |
| 2                    | 5-10                          |
| 3                    | 11-16                         |
| 4                    | 17-20                         | 

## Removing a Transformation
Reversing a transformation is an incredibly difficult process. The changes that have occurred in a character have fundamentally altered their biology, and perhaps their mind. However, anything is possible in a magical world. To cure a transformation, treat it as a curse from the curses section. The curse level of a transformation is equal to the character’s transformation level.
Rather than casting remove curse with the cure components, the regenerate spell must be cast with the cure components instead. A character that has reached the 4th level of a transformation, or that has been transformed for longer than
one year, can only be cured by a wish spell. If a character is killed and resurrected, the GM decides if they are resurrected with transformation levels.
