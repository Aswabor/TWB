## General Rules
### Conditions
[[System Reference/Conditions|Conditions]]

### Jumping
Your Strength determines how far you can jump.

#### Long Jump
When you make a Long Jump, you cover a number of feet up to your **Strength score** if you move at least **10 feet** on foot immediately before the jump. When you make a **standing Long Jump**, you can leap only **half that distance**. Either way, **each foot** you clear on the jump **costs a foot of Movement**.
This rule assumes that the height of your jump doesn’t matter, such as a jump across a stream or chasm. At your GM’s option, you must succeed on a DC 10 Strength (Athletics) check to clear a low obstacle (no taller than a quarter of the jump’s distance), such as a hedge or low wall. Otherwise, you hit it.
When you land in Difficult Terrain, you must succeed on a DC 10 Dexterity (Acrobatics) check to land on your feet. Otherwise, you land prone.

#### High Jump
When you make a High Jump, you leap into the air a number of feet equal to **3 + your Strength modifier** if you move at least 10 feet on foot immediately before the jump. When you make a standing High Jump, you can jump only half that distance. Either way, each foot you clear on the jump costs a foot of Movement. In some circumstances, your GM might allow you to make a Strength (Athletics) check to jump higher than you normally can.

You can extend your arms half your height above yourself during the jump. Thus, you can reach above you a distance equal to the height of the jump plus 1½ times your height.

### Stationary
A Stationary object is big enough or important enough to get its own encounter map (DM call). Any spell is allways relative to the refrence frame of the surfece of the target.

### Seafaring
#### SHIPS AND INITIATIVE
A ship rolls initiative using its Dexterity, and it uses its [[System Reference/Seafaring/Crew|crew]]'s quality score as a modifier to that roll. On a ship's turn, the captain decides which of the ship's actions to use.
