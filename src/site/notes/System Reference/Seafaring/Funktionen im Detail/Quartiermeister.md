# Quartermaster (AKA the Chief Steward)
The Quartermaster is in charge of overseeing ship preparations and its supply stores. They also assign crew quarters.

**Playing the Quartermaster:** You are responsible for all treasure found or claimed by the ship. The Quartermaster identifies, evaluates, keeps safe and evenly divides all treasure. If there are magical items, or other useful items in his safekeeping that could be of help in the current battle, he shall notify the Captain and recommend possible uses.

## Quartermaster’s Actions:
**Provide Common Item:** It is assumed that there are plenty of items that would normally be found on the deck of a ship (rope, barrels, belaying pins, etc.) but occasionally a necessary item that is not quite as common is destroyed, misplaced or falls overboard. Such Items would include a spyglass, an hourglass, some navigational tool, etc. The quartermaster may be able to find a spare that he has packed away for just such an emergency. He will be able to come up with the item on a successful DC 15 Intelligence (Investigation) check.

**Provide Uncommon Item:** Before the ships leaves port, the quartermaster stores away a small number of uncommon items. These are items that are not essential to the running of the ship, but may be occasionally useful. These might include such items as mirrors, games, hard candy, items of apparel, various types of tools, etc. If an officer requests a particular item, the quartermaster can find him one on a successful DC 20 Intelligence (Investigation) check. If he fails the check by 5 or less, he will find a different, but similar item.

**Provide Rare Item:** On a DC 25 Intelligence (Investigation) check, the quartermaster can come up with a very specific (mon-magical) item request. For example, he may be asked to find a disguise kit with a particular high top hat and floppy boots, like the one that the enemy ship’s captain wears.

**FORAGE:** The character casts fishing lines, keeping an eye out for sources of food, making a Wisdom (Survival) check when the DM calls for it.
