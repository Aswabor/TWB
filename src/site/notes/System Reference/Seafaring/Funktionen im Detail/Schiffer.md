# Navigator (AKA the Second Mate, or Skipper)
He directs the course and looks after the maps and instruments necessary for navigation. Since the charts are often inaccurate or nonexistent, his job is a difficult one. It is said that a good navigator is worth his weight in gold. He is perhaps the most valued person aboard a ship other than the captain because so much depended upon his skill. The navigator is expert at reading and correcting charts, using navigational tools such as the cross-staff, backstaff, quadrant, and sextant (depending on time period). He is also expert at using dead reckoning methods for determining longitude. Some are also capable of determining longitude using lunar observations (taking lunars). The sea artist was also an expert at reading the ocean, able to tell shallows and hidden reefs from deep waters and able to determine if storms were coming.

**Playing the Navigator:** You are responsible for tracking the ships location during voyages. During battle, it is your responsibility to identify and communicate with the other ships, both friend and foe (in response to his Captain’s wishes). The Navigator watches the water depth and currents. He keeps an eye on weather conditions. He receives reports from lookouts, makes his own observations and is in constant communication with the Captain.

**Full Ahead/Heave To:** The Skipper is in charge of determining the speed of the vessel by ordering the crew to lay on more sail or draw the sails in. This changes the ship's speed up or down as desired not to exceed the ship’s maximum speed.

## Navigator’s Actions:
The Navigator can perform any combat action normally available during a combat round or he can choose one of the following actions.

**Spot Weakness:** Make a DC 15 Wis check to spot a weakness on a target, giving one piece of artillery or attacking character advantage on one attack roll against that target this round

**Signal Flag:** It is the ship’s Navigator’s responsibility to communicate with other ships at sea. This is primarily by directing the raising of generally recognized set of signal flags. Ships typically fly their national flags, so they will be recognized by that. In addition, there are universal signals. A white flag means "we come in peace" while a black flag was the universal signal of a pirate, as it signals "we come to fight." A yellow flag means sickness on board. A more complicated message can be delivered with a series of flags, no more than a few words in length. Of course there is no guarantee that the other ships will respond.

**Recon Target:** Make a DC 10 Wis check to learn the current HP, flag, remaining crew, or other information about enemy ship. Requires a spyglass.

**NAVIGATE:** The skipper can try to prevent the ship from becoming lost, making a Wisdom (Survival) check when the DM calls for it.
