# First Mate (AKA the First Officer)
The officer who ranks just below the Captain of the ship and takes over in the event that the Captain can no longer perform his duties. He protects the seaman against each other by maintaining order, settling quarrels, and distributing food and other essentials.

**Playing the First Mate:** Your primary job as First Mate is carrying out the Captains commands. If the Captain selects a ship maneuver that has a prerequisite that isn’t currently met, but that can be met in a few rounds if another maneuver is performed first, it is your job to delay the Captains order and substitute the other ship maneuver until the prerequisites are met. This will normally be to turn the ship or move it closer to the enemy ship.

You are also responsible for keeping track of the ships location In relation to any hazard or to other ships. During battle, you must keep tract of the range between your ship and the enemy ship. Also, you must keep track of the direction your ship is facing, in relation to the enemy ship and the wind direction. This can easily be done with ship models, or cut-outs, or even pencils.

## First Mate’s Actions:
Ordering a ship maneuver is a free action for the First Mate. He can also perform any combat action normally available during a combat round or he can choose one of the following actions.

**Fill in:** The First Mate can take any other officer’s action that is not being performed this round.

**Look Alive:** The First Mate drives the crew to pay close attention to their jobs making the ship sail smoothly and well. With a successful DC 10 Charisma (Persuasion) check you grant the Pilot a +2 on his sailing check.

**Take Cover:** The First Mate orders the crew protect themselves from incoming siege weapon fire, magical attacks, etc... the crew gets +8 cover bonus to AC, but the Pilot gets a -4 penalty to sailing checks, and Archers and Artillerist get -4 to their attacks.

**Brace for Impact:** Order the crew to hunker down for one round. This is typically in response to an expected ram attack. Until this officer’s next turn, the crew has resistance to all damage other than psychic, and all sailing checks have disadvantage. Your Archers and Artillerist cannot attack.

**RAISE MORALE:** The first mate can manage the crew's time to grant extended breaks, provide instruction, and generally improve the quality of life on the ship. Once every 24 hours, if the crew's quality score is 3 or lower, the first mate can make a DC 15 Charisma (Persuasion) check. On a successful check, the crew's quality score increases by 1.
