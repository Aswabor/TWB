# Captain (AKA Commander)
The ultimate authority on any ship, his word is law to all on board. The captain chooses where to sail, what to plunder, and who fills the other stations aboard the vessel, among many other command decisions. Leadership often proves perilous, however, as a captain is, above all, meant to secure success for his ship and crew. Failing to do so increases the threat of mutiny. He is normally an experienced sailor, navigator and commander.

The individual in command of the vessel must be available each turn to direct the actions of the crew and observe the enemy’s actions. If the commander fails to direct the ship’s movement he cannot direct the pilot to change heading or the watch to change speed, or order the ship to perform any special maneuvers. This role is for someone on the deck of the ship shouting orders to the crew, relaying info from the lookout to the pilot and so on. Imagine him standing in the bow or on the sterncastle with a spyglass.

**Playing the Captain:** You are responsible for all of the decisions regarding ship. A successful Captain will listen to the advice of others, but it is ultimately your job to control the ship. During combat, at the start of each round you can order any ship maneuver. The Captain will tell his First Mate what ship maneuver he wants to attempt, but it is the First Mates job to see to it that it gets done. If necessary, the First Mate may delay that maneuver for a few rounds to first move the ship into position.

## Captain’s Actions:
Selection of a ship maneuver is a free action for the Captain. He can also perform any combat action normally available during a combat round or he can choose one of the following actions.

**Rally:** The Captain can attempt to intimidate/inspire the crew once per battle for an advantage on a roll of his choice. Make a Charisma check. Subtract the crew’s loyalty from 20 to arrive at the DC for the check.

**All hands on deck:** Call all crewmen to the deck and they take their pre-assigned positions for combat. This requires 1d4+2 rounds. There is usually time enough to do this before the start of the battle. (If there is not enough room on deck, the rest of the crew remains below deck ready to emerge if needed.)

**Attack:** “Fire at will” - directs the weapons master to attack the enemy ship. Alternately you could command him to “Load and aim all siege engines and await my command to fire”, or “Fire a warning shot across their bow” or any other attack command from “Wait until you see the whites of their eyes” to “Arm siege engines. Fire everything we've got!”. Select one of the ship's weapons that is within 10 feet of the officer. It gains advantage on the next attack roll it makes before the end of the ship's next turn.

**Cease Hostilities:** Stop all attacks against the enemy ship

**Strike Colors (Surrender ):** It is an offense to continue to fight after striking one's colors, and an offense to continue to fire on an enemy after she has struck her colors, unless he indicates by some other action, such as continuing to fire or seeking to escape, that he has not truly surrendered.

**Request Parley:** Hoisting a white flag, in itself, is not an indication of surrender. Rather, hoisting a white flag indicates a request for a truce in order to communicate with the enemy.

**Abandon Ship:** In most instances the captain of the ship forgoes his own rapid departure of a ship in distress, and concentrates instead on saving other people. It often results in either the death or belated rescue of the captain as the last person on board.

**Command Decision:** Direct an officer to take a specific action. This adds +2 to the officer’s ability check.

**Study the situation:** - You take no action this round. On the following round you can add +2 to one ability check for you or any officer.

**STEALTH:** The ship's captain can engage in this activity only if the weather conditions restrict visibility, such as in heavy fog. The ship makes a Dexterity check with a bonus equal to the crew's quality score to determine if it can hide.
