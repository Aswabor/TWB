# Ship’s Carpenter (AKA the Ship’s Engineer or Shipwright)
The Ship’s Carpenter is responsible for the maintenance and repair of the wooden hull, masts, hatches and yards. He works under the direction of the ship's First Mate The Carpenter checks the hull regularly, placing oakum between the seams of the planks and wooden plugs on leaks to keep the vessel tight. He is highly skilled in his work which he learned through apprenticeship. He repairs damage, or adjusts ship components to improve performance. Must be in whichever location he’s fixing or modifying.

**Playing the Ship’s Carpenter:** You are responsible for tracking the ships remaining hit points, both hull points and Mount points. The Ship’s Carpenter must keep the Captain informed of all ship damage that threatens the ships speed or safety, and of the current stare of repairs. He has the primary responsibility of repairing damage to the ship. He is also the primary person responsible for putting out any fires.

## Ship’s Carpenter Actions:
The ship’s Carpenter can perform any combat action normally available during a combat round or he can choose one of the following actions.

**Damage Control Check:** Once in 4 rounds, the ship’s Carpenter can attempt a DC 15 Wisdom check. On success, the ship gains a number of temporary hit points equal to twice his Wisdom modifier, or may end one damaging effect effecting the ship.

**Reinforce hull:** The ship’s Carpenter can spend a round adding temporary auxiliary bracing to a section of the hull - making it more difficult to damage. This provides the ship with 1d4 temporary hit points to the hull (temporary hull points).

**Repair minor damage:** The ship’s carpenter jumps into action whenever there is a mishap or problem on the ship either due to siege weapon damage or any other reason: a spar breaks, a sail flies loose, a siege engine misfires etc... With a successful DC 15 Dexterity check using Carpenter’s tools the problem can be jury-rigged sufficiently to remove any penalties or prevent further damage.

**Repair Hull Damage:** In one round, with a successful DC 15 Dexterity check using Carpenter’s tools the ship’s carpenter can repair 1 point of Hull damage, but in a given encounter, no more than half the ship’s Hull’s Hit Points can be repaired. Repairing damage can halt listing or sinking.

**REPAIR:** At the end of the day, the ship's bosun can make a Strength check using carpenter's tools or a Dexterity check using Tinkerer's tools. On a 15 or higher. each damaged component regains hit points equal to 1d6 + the crew's quality score (minimum of 1 hit point). A component other than the hull that had 0 hit points becomes functional again.
