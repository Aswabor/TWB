# Captain (AKA Commander)
The ultimate authority on any ship, his word is law to all on board. The captain chooses where to sail, what to plunder, and who fills the other stations aboard the vessel, among many other command decisions. Leadership often proves perilous, however, as a captain is, above all, meant to secure success for his ship and crew. Failing to do so increases the threat of mutiny. He is normally an experienced sailor, navigator and commander.

The individual in command of the vessel must be available each turn to direct the actions of the crew and observe the enemy’s actions. If the commander fails to direct the ship’s movement he cannot direct the pilot to change heading or the watch to change speed, or order the ship to perform any special maneuvers. This role is for someone on the deck of the ship shouting orders to the crew, relaying info from the lookout to the pilot and so on. Imagine him standing in the bow or on the sterncastle with a spyglass.

**Playing the Captain:** You are responsible for all of the decisions regarding ship. A successful Captain will listen to the advice of others, but it is ultimately your job to control the ship. During combat, at the start of each round you can order any ship maneuver. The Captain will tell his First Mate what ship maneuver he wants to attempt, but it is the First Mates job to see to it that it gets done. If necessary, the First Mate may delay that maneuver for a few rounds to first move the ship into position.

## Captain’s Actions:
Selection of a ship maneuver is a free action for the Captain. He can also perform any combat action normally available during a combat round or he can choose one of the following actions.

**Rally:** The Captain can attempt to intimidate/inspire the crew once per battle for an advantage on a roll of his choice. Make a Charisma check. Subtract the crew’s loyalty from 20 to arrive at the DC for the check.

**All hands on deck:** Call all crewmen to the deck and they take their pre-assigned positions for combat. This requires 1d4+2 rounds. There is usually time enough to do this before the start of the battle. (If there is not enough room on deck, the rest of the crew remains below deck ready to emerge if needed.)

**Attack:** “Fire at will” - directs the weapons master to attack the enemy ship. Alternately you could command him to “Load and aim all siege engines and await my command to fire”, or “Fire a warning shot across their bow” or any other attack command from “Wait until you see the whites of their eyes” to “Arm siege engines. Fire everything we've got!”. Select one of the ship's weapons that is within 10 feet of the officer. It gains advantage on the next attack roll it makes before the end of the ship's next turn.

**Cease Hostilities:** Stop all attacks against the enemy ship

**Strike Colors (Surrender ):** It is an offense to continue to fight after striking one's colors, and an offense to continue to fire on an enemy after she has struck her colors, unless he indicates by some other action, such as continuing to fire or seeking to escape, that he has not truly surrendered.

**Request Parley:** Hoisting a white flag, in itself, is not an indication of surrender. Rather, hoisting a white flag indicates a request for a truce in order to communicate with the enemy.

**Abandon Ship:** In most instances the captain of the ship forgoes his own rapid departure of a ship in distress, and concentrates instead on saving other people. It often results in either the death or belated rescue of the captain as the last person on board.

**Command Decision:** Direct an officer to take a specific action. This adds +2 to the officer’s ability check.

**Study the situation:** - You take no action this round. On the following round you can add +2 to one ability check for you or any officer.

**STEALTH:** The ship's captain can engage in this activity only if the weather conditions restrict visibility, such as in heavy fog. The ship makes a Dexterity check with a bonus equal to the crew's quality score to determine if it can hide.

# First Mate (AKA the First Officer)
The officer who ranks just below the Captain of the ship and takes over in the event that the Captain can no longer perform his duties. He protects the seaman against each other by maintaining order, settling quarrels, and distributing food and other essentials.

**Playing the First Mate:** Your primary job as First Mate is carrying out the Captains commands. If the Captain selects a ship maneuver that has a prerequisite that isn’t currently met, but that can be met in a few rounds if another maneuver is performed first, it is your job to delay the Captains order and substitute the other ship maneuver until the prerequisites are met. This will normally be to turn the ship or move it closer to the enemy ship.

You are also responsible for keeping track of the ships location In relation to any hazard or to other ships. During battle, you must keep tract of the range between your ship and the enemy ship. Also, you must keep track of the direction your ship is facing, in relation to the enemy ship and the wind direction. This can easily be done with ship models, or cut-outs, or even pencils.

## First Mate’s Actions:
Ordering a ship maneuver is a free action for the First Mate. He can also perform any combat action normally available during a combat round or he can choose one of the following actions.

**Fill in:** The First Mate can take any other officer’s action that is not being performed this round.

**Look Alive:** The First Mate drives the crew to pay close attention to their jobs making the ship sail smoothly and well. With a successful DC 10 Charisma (Persuasion) check you grant the Pilot a +2 on his sailing check.

**Take Cover:** The First Mate orders the crew protect themselves from incoming siege weapon fire, magical attacks, etc... the crew gets +8 cover bonus to AC, but the Pilot gets a -4 penalty to sailing checks, and Archers and Artillerist get -4 to their attacks.

**Brace for Impact:** Order the crew to hunker down for one round. This is typically in response to an expected ram attack. Until this officer’s next turn, the crew has resistance to all damage other than psychic, and all sailing checks have disadvantage. Your Archers and Artillerist cannot attack.

**RAISE MORALE:** The first mate can manage the crew's time to grant extended breaks, provide instruction, and generally improve the quality of life on the ship. Once every 24 hours, if the crew's quality score is 3 or lower, the first mate can make a DC 15 Charisma (Persuasion) check. On a successful check, the crew's quality score increases by 1.

### Quartiermeister
The Quartermaster is in charge of logistics on board, ensuring that there is enough food on board for the whole crew. His Primary domain is the hold. Good bartering skills are beneficial.

<div class="transclusion internal-embed is-loaded"><div class="markdown-embed">




# Quartermaster (AKA the Chief Steward)
The Quartermaster is in charge of overseeing ship preparations and its supply stores. They also assign crew quarters.

**Playing the Quartermaster:** You are responsible for all treasure found or claimed by the ship. The Quartermaster identifies, evaluates, keeps safe and evenly divides all treasure. If there are magical items, or other useful items in his safekeeping that could be of help in the current battle, he shall notify the Captain and recommend possible uses.

## Quartermaster’s Actions:
**Provide Common Item:** It is assumed that there are plenty of items that would normally be found on the deck of a ship (rope, barrels, belaying pins, etc.) but occasionally a necessary item that is not quite as common is destroyed, misplaced or falls overboard. Such Items would include a spyglass, an hourglass, some navigational tool, etc. The quartermaster may be able to find a spare that he has packed away for just such an emergency. He will be able to come up with the item on a successful DC 15 Intelligence (Investigation) check.

**Provide Uncommon Item:** Before the ships leaves port, the quartermaster stores away a small number of uncommon items. These are items that are not essential to the running of the ship, but may be occasionally useful. These might include such items as mirrors, games, hard candy, items of apparel, various types of tools, etc. If an officer requests a particular item, the quartermaster can find him one on a successful DC 20 Intelligence (Investigation) check. If he fails the check by 5 or less, he will find a different, but similar item.

**Provide Rare Item:** On a DC 25 Intelligence (Investigation) check, the quartermaster can come up with a very specific (mon-magical) item request. For example, he may be asked to find a disguise kit with a particular high top hat and floppy boots, like the one that the enemy ship’s captain wears.

**FORAGE:** The character casts fishing lines, keeping an eye out for sources of food, making a Wisdom (Survival) check when the DM calls for it.

### Schiffer
The skipper plots the ship’s course, relying on knowledge of nautical charts and a study of weather and sea conditions. A reliable skipper tends to have a high Wisdom score, as well as proficiency with navigator’s tools and the Nature skill.
>
<div class="transclusion internal-embed is-loaded"><div class="markdown-embed">




# Navigator (AKA the Second Mate, or Skipper)
He directs the course and looks after the maps and instruments necessary for navigation. Since the charts are often inaccurate or nonexistent, his job is a difficult one. It is said that a good navigator is worth his weight in gold. He is perhaps the most valued person aboard a ship other than the captain because so much depended upon his skill. The navigator is expert at reading and correcting charts, using navigational tools such as the cross-staff, backstaff, quadrant, and sextant (depending on time period). He is also expert at using dead reckoning methods for determining longitude. Some are also capable of determining longitude using lunar observations (taking lunars). The sea artist was also an expert at reading the ocean, able to tell shallows and hidden reefs from deep waters and able to determine if storms were coming.

**Playing the Navigator:** You are responsible for tracking the ships location during voyages. During battle, it is your responsibility to identify and communicate with the other ships, both friend and foe (in response to his Captain’s wishes). The Navigator watches the water depth and currents. He keeps an eye on weather conditions. He receives reports from lookouts, makes his own observations and is in constant communication with the Captain.

**Full Ahead/Heave To:** The Skipper is in charge of determining the speed of the vessel by ordering the crew to lay on more sail or draw the sails in. This changes the ship's speed up or down as desired not to exceed the ship’s maximum speed.

## Navigator’s Actions:
The Navigator can perform any combat action normally available during a combat round or he can choose one of the following actions.

**Spot Weakness:** Make a DC 15 Wis check to spot a weakness on a target, giving one piece of artillery or attacking character advantage on one attack roll against that target this round

**Signal Flag:** It is the ship’s Navigator’s responsibility to communicate with other ships at sea. This is primarily by directing the raising of generally recognized set of signal flags. Ships typically fly their national flags, so they will be recognized by that. In addition, there are universal signals. A white flag means "we come in peace" while a black flag was the universal signal of a pirate, as it signals "we come to fight." A yellow flag means sickness on board. A more complicated message can be delivered with a series of flags, no more than a few words in length. Of course there is no guarantee that the other ships will respond.

**Recon Target:** Make a DC 10 Wis check to learn the current HP, flag, remaining crew, or other information about enemy ship. Requires a spyglass.

**NAVIGATE:** The skipper can try to prevent the ship from becoming lost, making a Wisdom (Survival) check when the DM calls for it.

# Ship’s Carpenter (AKA the Ship’s Engineer or Shipwright)
The Ship’s Carpenter is responsible for the maintenance and repair of the wooden hull, masts, hatches and yards. He works under the direction of the ship's First Mate The Carpenter checks the hull regularly, placing oakum between the seams of the planks and wooden plugs on leaks to keep the vessel tight. He is highly skilled in his work which he learned through apprenticeship. He repairs damage, or adjusts ship components to improve performance. Must be in whichever location he’s fixing or modifying.

**Playing the Ship’s Carpenter:** You are responsible for tracking the ships remaining hit points, both hull points and Mount points. The Ship’s Carpenter must keep the Captain informed of all ship damage that threatens the ships speed or safety, and of the current stare of repairs. He has the primary responsibility of repairing damage to the ship. He is also the primary person responsible for putting out any fires.

## Ship’s Carpenter Actions:
The ship’s Carpenter can perform any combat action normally available during a combat round or he can choose one of the following actions.

**Damage Control Check:** Once in 4 rounds, the ship’s Carpenter can attempt a DC 15 Wisdom check. On success, the ship gains a number of temporary hit points equal to twice his Wisdom modifier, or may end one damaging effect effecting the ship.

**Reinforce hull:** The ship’s Carpenter can spend a round adding temporary auxiliary bracing to a section of the hull - making it more difficult to damage. This provides the ship with 1d4 temporary hit points to the hull (temporary hull points).

**Repair minor damage:** The ship’s carpenter jumps into action whenever there is a mishap or problem on the ship either due to siege weapon damage or any other reason: a spar breaks, a sail flies loose, a siege engine misfires etc... With a successful DC 15 Dexterity check using Carpenter’s tools the problem can be jury-rigged sufficiently to remove any penalties or prevent further damage.

**Repair Hull Damage:** In one round, with a successful DC 15 Dexterity check using Carpenter’s tools the ship’s carpenter can repair 1 point of Hull damage, but in a given encounter, no more than half the ship’s Hull’s Hit Points can be repaired. Repairing damage can halt listing or sinking.

**REPAIR:** At the end of the day, the ship's bosun can make a Strength check using carpenter's tools or a Dexterity check using Tinkerer's tools. On a 15 or higher. each damaged component regains hit points equal to 1d6 + the crew's quality score (minimum of 1 hit point). A component other than the hull that had 0 hit points becomes functional again.

# Crew
## CREW MEMBERS
A ship requires a number of able-bodied sailors to crew it, as specified in its stat block. A crew's skill, experience, morale. and health are defined by its quality score. This score can affect a number of general ship activities, like the crew's ability to notice threats or contend with hazards. A crew starts with a quality score of +4. but that score varies over time, going as low as - 10 and as high as +10. It decreases as a crew takes casualties. suffers hardship, or endures poor health. It increases if the crew enjoys high morale, has good health care, and receives fair leadership.  
(A typical crew member uses the commoner stat block in the Monster Manual.)

---
## LOYALTY AND QUALITY
When dealing with an individual member of the crew, you might find it useful to use the optional [[System Reference/Loyalty|loyalty]] rule from chapter 4 of the Dungeon Master's Guide. To convert a quality score into an individual's [[System Reference/Loyalty|loyalty]] score. add 10 to the crew's quality score.
>
<div class="transclusion internal-embed is-loaded"><div class="markdown-embed">




# LOYALTY
Loyalty is an optional rule you can use to determine how far an NPC party member will go to protect or assist the other members of the party (even those he or she doesn't particularly like). An NPC party member who is abused or ignored is likely to abandon or betray the party, whereas an NPC who owes a life debt to the characters or shares their goals might fight to the death for them. Loyalty can be roleplayed or represented by this rule.

## LOYALTY SCORE
An NPC's loyalty is measured on a numerical scale from 0 to 20. The NPC's maximum loyalty score is equal to the highest Charisma score among all adventurers in the party, and its starting loyalty score is half that number. If the highest Charisma score changes (perhaps a character dies or leaves the group) adjust the NPC's loyalty score accordingly.

## TRACKING LOYALTY
Keep track of an NPC's loyalty score in secret so that the players won't know for sure whether an NPC party member is loyal or disloyal (even if the NPC is currently under a player's control).
An NPC's loyalty score increases by 1d4 if other party members help the NPC achieve a goal tied to its bond. Likewise, an NPC's loyalty score increases by 1d4 if the NPC is treated particularly well (for example, given a magic weapon as a gift) or rescued by another party member. An NPC's loyalty score can never be raised above its maximum.
When other party members act in a manner that runs counter to the NPC's alignment or bond, reduce the NPC's loyalty score by 1d4. Reduce the NPC's loyalty score by 2d4 if the character is abused, misled, or endangered by other party members for purely selfish reasons.
An NPC whose loyalty score drops to 0 is no longer loyal to the party and might part ways with them. A loyalty score can never drop below 0.
An NPC with a loyalty score of **10 or higher risks life and limb** to help fellow party members. If the NPC's loyalty score is **between 1 and 10, its loyalty is tenuous**. An NPC whose **loyalty drops to 0 no longer acts in the party's best interests**. The disloyal NPC either leaves the party (attacking characters who attempt to intervene) or works in secret to bring about the party's downfall.

</div></div>


---
## MUTINY
A poorly led or mistreated crew might turn against its officers. Once per day, if a crew's quality score is lower than 0, the captain must make a Charisma (Intimidation or Persuasion) check modified by the crew's qualityscore. If the check total is between 1 and 9. the crew's quality score decreases by 1.
If the check total is 0 or lower, the crew mutinies. They become hostile to the officers and might attempt to kill them. imprison them, or throw them overboard.
The crew can be cowed into obedience through violence, combat, or offers of treasure or other rewards. When the DM ends tbe mutiny, the crew's quaHty score increases by `dice: 1d4`.

---
## SHORE LEAVE
Life aboard a ship is a constant wear on the crew. Spending time in port allows the crew to relax and re- gain its composure.
If a crew's quality score is 3 or lower, the score increases by 1 for each day the crew spends in port or ashore.
