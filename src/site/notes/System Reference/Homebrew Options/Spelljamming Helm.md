# Artifurnace
WJMAiSp33[](https://www.dropbox.com/sh/3c88jrhy1t7gyql/AACS63QaKFCCrBn_-cxRVHBda "View Homebrew Source")

Wondrous item, artifact (requires attunement)

This Helm is a modernized version of the [Furnace Helm](https://5e.tools/items.html#furnace%20helm%20(minor)_wjmais). Like the Furnace Helm, the _Artifurnace_ is designed to burn magical items and convert their power into propulsion. However, the _Artifurnace_ is designed to draw power from an artifact tier magic item, which are known to be indestructible. As a result, the _Artifurnace_ is an endless source of propuslion.

This Helm counts as an 11th level spellcaster for [Spell Surge](https://5e.tools/optionalfeatures.html#spell%20surge_wjmais) and _Hover Sailing_, though a Helmsman is still required to control the helm.

If a sentient magic item is used as the artifact in the _Artifurnace_, that sentient magic item becomes the Helmsman of the wildjammer.
