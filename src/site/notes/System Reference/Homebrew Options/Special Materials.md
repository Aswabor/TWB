# Special Materials
## Metal
Armor, shields, and weapons are most commonly crafted out of various types of common or precious metals. Steel, bronze, and iron are commonplace, but some smiths forge rare items out of these rare materials.

### Adamantine
Adamantine is one of the hardest substances in existence. It’s an ultrahard metal found in meteorites and extraordinary mineral veins.

**Weapon:** Melee weapons and ammunition made from or coated with adamantine are unusually effective when used to break objects. Whenever an adamantine weapon or piece of ammunition hits an object, the hit is a critical hit.

**Armor & Shield:** While you're wearing armor or wielding a shield made with adamantine, any critical hit against you becomes a normal hit.

---
### Mithral
Mithral is a light, flexible metal. A mithral chain shirt or breastplate can be worn under normal clothes. Items made of mithral weigh half as much as normal.

**Weapon:** A weapon made of mithral loses the Heavy property, or gains the Light property if it does not have the Heavy property.

**Armor:** If the armor normally imposes DisADV on Stealth or Acrobatics Checks or has a Strength requirement, the mithral version of the armor doesn’t. It also removes the Bulky and Cumbersome properties.

**Shield:** All shields made from mithral have the Thrown property for 2x the distance and lose the Bulky property.

---
### Cold Iron
This iron mined deep underground, known for its effectiveness against fey creatures, is forged at a lower temperature to preserve its latent properties. Items made of cold iron cost twice as much to make as their normal counterparts.

**Weapon:** When you make a weapon attack and hit a fey creature with a weapon or piece of ammunition made from cold iron, it deals an additional die of damage and the creature is Impaired until the start of your next turn.

**Armor:** While you are wearing armor or wielding a shield made of cold iron, fey creatures have DisADV on melee attacks against you, and you have ADV on saves to resist being Charmed by them.

**Shield:** If you are the target of a Charmed or domination effect, you can use a Reaction to raise your shield and reflect the spell back (if you make the save).

---
### Lead
Lead is one of the most dense substances in existence, so much so that magic itself seems to not be able to penetrate it. There are many drawbacks to wearing lead, but also many benefits. If you are wearing or wielding Items made from Lead you cannot be the target of Divination spells.

**Weapon:** Weapons made from lead gain the Heavy property, and if it would already have that property then it’ll require a minimum Strength score of 20 to wield it. Weapon attacks with lead weapons receive a -2 to hit but gain a +2 to damage rolls.

**Armor:** Armor made from lead reduces the wearer’s movement speed by 5ft and the armor type increases by one level, ie Light becomes Medium, and Medium becomes Heavy. If the armor is already Heavy then it’ll require a minimum Strength score of 20 to wear it. While wearing lead armor your AC gains a +1 bonus and you are resistant to Psychic damage.

**Shield:** Wielding a shield made from lead results in a loss of 5ft of your movement speed in exchange for a +1 to the shield’s AC bonus. You become resistant to Lightning damage and immediately succeed on any saves against spells that deal Lightning damage.

### Silver

Silver is known for its potency against incorporeal and shapeshifting creatures. Silvered weapons have properties to both deal damage to these creatures and protect yourself from them.

**Shield:** You double the AC from your shield against any attacks from incorporeal or shapeshifting creatures.

## Wood
Wood is used to make many types of weapons. Special forms of wood can be used in place of metal or cloth. Wood items are not subject to spells and effects that target metal.

### Lightwood
Lightwood is a rare form of wood that is commonly used by druids to craft armor and weapons. This rare magic wood is as hard as normal wood but very light. Any wooden, or mostly wooden, item (such as a bow, an arrow, or a spear) made from lightwood weighs only half as much as a normal wooden item of that type.

### Shadewood
Shadewood is harvested from forests located on the shadow plane. Its weight and texture are the same as normal wood, but its colors are grayscale with a high contrast between different shades of black and gray. There is a strange sense of altered reality when holding shadewood, as if it might be some elaborate illusion.

### Heavywood
This exceptionally hard wood is useful in the manufacture of armor and weapons. Unlike most woods, heavywood can be used instead of metal to fashion heavy armor and weapons— it is somewhat shapeable during manufacturing, and it keeps a sharp edge.
