# Weapon Properties
## #W-Property/Ammunition
You can use a weapon that has the ammunition property to make a ranged attack only if you have ammunition to fire from the weapon. Each time you attack with the weapon, you expend one piece of ammunition. Drawing the ammunition from a quiver, case, or other container is part of the attack (you need a free hand to load a one-handed weapon). At the end of the battle, you can recover half your expended ammunition by taking a minute to search the battlefield. If you use a weapon that has the ammunition property to make a melee attack, you treat the weapon as an improvised weapon (see "Improvised Weapons" later in the section). A sling must be loaded to deal any damage when used in this way.

---
## #W-Property/Armor-Piercing
An armor-piercing weapon is a melee weapon designed to punch through armor and thick hide alike. When you make an attack roll using an armor-piercing weapon, you gain a +1 bonus to the attack roll if your target is wearing armor or has natural armor.

---
## #W-Property/Blackpowder
Blackpowder weapons fire projectiles with ear-splitting noise, shredding armour with deadly force. When fired, Blackpowder weapons emit a deafening crack audible 300 feet away. Unfortunately, Blackpowder weapons often become useless when wet. If a Blackpowder weapon is exposed to heavy rain, submerged, or drenched in water by a similar means, then it cannot fire. A character cannot use this weapon again until they complete a short rest in dry conditions.

---
## #W-Property/Brutal
Brutal weapons are designed to subject an adversary to the most harm. When you score a critical hit against a creature with a Brutal weapon, you can add an additional weapon damage die to the damage dealt.

---
## #W-Property/Cumbersome
Cumbersome weapons are difficult to wield but are effective tools for those strong enough to wield them. When making an attack with a Cumbersome weapon, you must use your Strength modifier for both the attack and damage rolls.

---
## #W-Property/Damage
An advanced weapon that has the damage property can deal an alternative form of damage. You can choose the type when you attack or when you hit with an attack from any of the damage types mentioned.

---
## #W-Property/Defending
A defending weapon is either made for parrying, has advanced techniques for use in parrying, or both. When you use a defending weapon, you can use your reaction to defend against a melee weapon attack that hits you. If you do, increase your AC by 1d4 against that attack.

---
## #W-Property/Disarming
A disarming weapon can catch a foe’s weapon, allowing you to remove it from their grasp. When an opponent misses you with a melee weapon attack, you can use your reaction to attempt to disarm them. Both you and the attacker must make contested attack rolls. If you roll higher, and the weapon is something the target can drop, the weapon falls from the target’s grasp, landing within 5 feet of the target in a space you choose. If you score a critical hit, and the attacker did not, you can send the weapon flying up to 15 feet away from the target into a space you choose instead. If you have a free hand when you score a critical hit this way, you can disarm the target so that you end up with the dropped weapon in your hand. If the attacker tied or rolled higher, then nothing happens.

---
## #W-Property/Double
A two-handed, double weapon functions as two light weapons, one in each hand, for two-weapon fighting purposes. If a double weapon has the reach property, you can use only one of these properties during the same turn.

---
## #W-Property/Entangling
An entangling weapon can tie a target up. When you hit with an entangling weapon attack against a target no more than one size larger than you, you can use your bonus action to attempt to grapple the target. (This bonus-action use applies when you throw an entangling weapon because you’re throwing with special preparation.) You don’t need a free hand—the weapon fulfills that requirement. If you succeed, the target is grappled by you or the weapon if you’re no longer holding it. Until the grapple ends, you can’t use the entangling weapon to attack a different target. If you aren’t holding the entangling weapon, such as when you throw a gladiator net, the grapple continues, and the target needs to succeed at a DC 10 Dexterity (Acrobatics) or Strength (Athletics) check to escape the weapon.

---
## #W-Property/Finesse
When making an attack with a finesse weapon, you use your choice of your Strength or Dexterity modifier for the attack and damage rolls. You must use the same modifier for both rolls.

---
## #W-Property/Guard
Guard weapons are made to fight defensively, often designed with a long reach or flat surface for parrying. While wielding a Guard weapon, whenever a hostile creature moves within your reach, and you did not move on your last turn, you can use a reaction to make a weapon attack with a Guard weapon against that creature. If the attack hits, then it deals no damage, the creature immediately stops and its speed becomes 0 until the end of its turn.

---
## #W-Property/Hafted
A hafted weapon’s haft can function well as an off-hand attack. When you attack with only the hafted weapon, you can use a bonus action to make a melee weapon attack with the haft. The haft deals 1d4 bludgeoning damage, and you add your ability modifier to damage as you would for other sorts of two-weapon fighting. If you have feats that mimic this ability, the damage dice becomes 1d8 instead.

---
## #W-Property/Heavy
Small creatures have disadvantage on attack rolls with heavy weapons. A heavy weapon's size and bulk make it too large for a Small creature to use effectively.

---
## #W-Property/Light
A light weapon is small and easy to handle, making it ideal for use when fighting with two weapons. See the rules for two-weapon fighting in chapter 9.

---
## #W-Property/Loading
Because of the time required to load this weapon, you can fire only one piece of ammunition from it when you use an action, bonus action, or reaction to fire it, regardless of the number of attacks you can normally make.

---
## #W-Property/Magazine
A weapon with the magazine property also has a number and an ammunition type. The weapon holds that amount and type of ammo, which you can expend before needing to reload the weapon. Removing or loading a magazine counts as your interaction with an object, so doing both in one turn takes an action. A magazine weapon comes with one empty magazine included in the weapon’s cost and weight. Loading an empty magazine with ammunition takes 1 minute.

---
## #W-Property/Momentum
Momentum weapons are designed to deliver devastating attacks as part of a charge. When you hit a creature with a Momentum weapon, and you have moved 20 feet or more in a straight line this turn, you can upgrade the damage dice to the weapon’s momentum dice value.

---
## #W-Property/Monk
A monk gains proficiency with advanced monk weapons at 5th level.

---
## #W-Property/Precise
When you attack with a precise weapon, you can score a critical hit on a roll of 19 or 20. If a feature or item you have increases the numbers you can roll for a critical hit, a precise weapon increases that range by one. A fighter with Superior Critical, for instance, scores a critical hit on a roll of 17 to 20 with a precise weapon. Any roll lower than 20 must still hit to be a critical hit—it’s not an automatic hit as if the roll was a 20.

---
## #W-Property/Range
A weapon that can be used to make a ranged attack has a range in parentheses after the ammunition or thrown property. The range lists two numbers. The first is the weapon's normal range in feet, and the second indicates the weapon's long range. When attacking a target beyond normal range, you have disadvantage on the attack roll. You can't attack a target beyond the weapon's long range.

---
## #W-Property/Reach
This weapon adds 5 feet to your reach when you attack with it, as well as when determining your reach for opportunity attacks with it. If a reach weapon has the double property, you can use only one of these properties during the same turn.

---
## #W-Property/Repeater
Repeater weapons fire rounds in quick succession, either using multiple barrels or quick reloading mechanisms. When you take the attack action with a Repeater weapon, you can use a bonus action to attack again with the same weapon. You don’t add your ability modifier to the damage of the second shot, unless that modifier is negative. You can make this bonus action even if the weapon has the Loading property.

---
## #W-Property/Restraining
Only entangling weapons can be restraining weapons. If you have a target grappled with a restraining weapon, and you succeed on another attempt to grapple the target with the same weapon, the target becomes restrained instead of grappled. The target then remains restrained until the grapple ends. If you stop holding the restraining weapon, the target can escape as if from an unheld entangling weapon.

---
## #W-Property/Returning
A returning weapon allows you to hurl the weapon in such a way that it returns to you. When you attack with a returning weapon, if you roll an even number on the d20, the weapon returns to you by the end of your turn. You can catch the weapon if you have a hand free to do so. If not, the weapon lands at a random point within 5 feet of you. If you roll an odd number on the d20 for the attack roll, the weapon fails to return to you.

---
## #W-Property/Scatter
Scatter weapons are capable of devastating multiple enemies at once. When you take the attack action and successfully hit a creature with a Scatter weapon, measure the weapon’s Scatter range from the square (or point of impact) that the target you hit occupies. All creatures other than the original target that fall within the weapon’s scatter range must make a Dexterity saving throw against your Scatter DC. Upon a failed save, they take damage equal to the ability score modifier you used to hit with the weapon (minimum of 1). Damage dealt this way is the same type as the weapon that you hit with.

>Scatter Save DC = 8 + your proficiency bonus + the ability score modifier that you use to determine damage for this weapon.
 
A weapon’s Scatter range and shape are mentioned in its statistics. For example, a Flame Bellows has a range of 15 feet and a Scatter range of 15 feet. This means the weapon can hit a target within 15 feet, and upon a hit, a 15-foot cone extending beyond the target will determine those hit by the Scatter effect, up to a total distance of 30 feet.

---
## #W-Property/Set
You can use a bonus action on your turn to prepare, or “set,” a set weapon against a foe moving toward you. A weapon becomes unset if you move or take any action after setting it. If a target enters your reach while you have the weapon set, you can use your reaction to make a melee attack with the set weapon against that target. If you hit, and your target moved 20 feet or more toward you before the attack, you can roll one of the weapon’s damage dice one additional time and add it to the damage total.

---
## #W-Property/Silvered
Some monsters that have immunity or resistanceto nonmagical weapons are susceptible to silver weapons, so cautious adventurers invest extra coin to plate their weapons with silver. You can silver a single weapon or ten pieces of ammunition for 100 gp. This cost represents not only the price of the silver, but the time and expertise needed to add silver to the weapon without making it less effective.

---
## #W-Property/Special
A weapon with the special property has unusual rules governing its use, explained in the weapon's description 
> Lance. You have disadvantage when you use a lance to attack a target within 5 feet of you. Also, a lance requires two hands to wield when you aren't mounted.

>Net. A Large or smaller creature hit by a net is restrained until it is freed. A net has no effect on creatures that are formless, or creatures that are Huge or larger. A creature can use its action to make a DC 10 Strength check, freeing itself or another creature within its reach on a success. Dealing 5 slashing damage to the net (AC 10) also frees the creature without harming it, ending the effect and destroying the net. When you use an action, bonus action, or reaction to attack with a net, you can make only one attack regardless of the number of attacks you can normally make.

---
## #W-Property/Strong-Draw
An advanced ranged weapon with the strong-draw quality requires great strength to use. You must have a Strength of 13 or higher to use such a weapon, or you make attack rolls using the weapon with disadvantage. You add not only your Dexterity modifier to damage with a strong-draw weapon, but you also add 1 + half your Strength Modifier (rounded down) to the damage.

---
## #W-Property/Swift
Swift weapons are renowned for their utility in recovering from missed attacks. When you miss an attack with a Swift weapon, you gain advantage on the next attack roll you make with that weapon against the same target.

---
## #W-Property/Thrown
If a weapon has the thrown property, you can throw the weapon to make a ranged attack. If the weapon is a melee weapon, you use the same ability modifier for that attack roll and damage roll that you would use for a melee attack with the weapon. For example, if you throw a hand axe, you use your Strength, but if you throw a dagger, you can use either your Strength or your Dexterity, since the dagger has the finesse property.

---
## #W-Property/Tripping 
A tripping weapon allows users to knock targets prone. When you hit with a tripping weapon, you can use a bonus action to force your target to attempt a Strength saving throw, provided the target is no more than one size larger than you. The DC for the saving throw equals 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Strength or Dexterity modifier (your choice). If the target fails, it falls prone.

---
## #W-Property/Two-Handed
This weapon requires two hands when you attack with it.

---
## #W-Property/Versatile
This weapon can be used with one or two hands. A damage value in parentheses appears with the property-the damage when the weapon is used with two hands to make a melee attack.

---
# Ammunition Properties
## Advanced ammunition
### Damage Types
Advanced ammunition named after a damage type deals that damage type. Arrows and bolts can have wide, slashing heads or heavy, bludgeoning tips. A sling bullet can have piercing facets. All such ammo is heavier than normal, so the weapon’s maximum range using it is half normal.

---
### Ranging
Ammunition that has the ranging property is lighter and better made than common counterparts. When you fire ranging ammo, you can increase your weapon’s normal range by 50 percent.

---
### Whistling
Ammunition with the whistling property creates a high-pitched sound after firing. This sound is audible for 300 feet from the ammo as it flies. Whistling ammo isn’t heavier, but it catches the air in baffles to create its sound, so its maximum range is half normal. Whistling ammo deals bludgeoning damage.

## Alchemical Advanced Ammunition
Alchemical ammunition carries an alchemical payload. Rather than hurling a vial as an improvised weapon, you fire alchemical ammunition from a projectile weapon, using your normal attack bonus with that weapon. Alchemical ammunition deals the ammo’s normal damage type in addition to delivering the alchemical effect. This ammo is heavy though, so a weapon’s maximum range using al- chemical ammo is half normal. The alchemical ammunition is destroyed once used, whether the attack hits or misses.

### Acid, Alchemist’s Fire, and Holy Water
Other than how you hit a creature using alchemical ammo, these substances have their normal effects.

### War-Oil
When you fire war-oil ammo at an area and hit AC 10, viscous oil covers the area within 5 feet of a point you target. If you target a creature, you must hit that creature’s AC to cover the creature in war oil. But if you hit the creature or AC 10, you can pick a point in or adjacent to that creature’s space to determine the war oil’s area as if you targeted a point.
War oil’s area is difficult terrain. A creature standing in the area when it appears, that starts its turn in the area, or that enters the area for the first time on a turn must succeed at a DC 13 Dexterity saving throw or fall prone.
War oil is also flammable. If lit, such as by dealing fire damage to a creature covered in the oil, the oil burns for 2 rounds. Burning war oil deals 2d4 fire damage to any creature ignited in this way. An ignited creature can douse the flames by using its action to make a DC 10 Dexterity saving throw to extinguish the flames. If the creature ends its turn still aflame, the creature takes 2d4 fire damage. If war oil ignites in an area, a creature takes fire 1d4 damage when it enters the area for the first time on its turn or starts its turn in that area. A creature can take fire damage from war oil only once per round.
>War oil dries and ceases to be slippery or flammable after 1 minute.

## Specialised Ammunition
>Specialised ammunition can have one weapon property with (A) next to its name. This property is applied when the ammunition is purchased or crafted, and cannot be changed.

### Armour Piercing (A)
When you roll to hit a creature with an Armour Piercing weapon or ammunition, if the target is wearing heavy armour or natural armour that exceeds 17, then you receive +2 on your attack roll to hit that target.

### Blessed (A)
When a creature that is a fiend, fey, or undead is hit with a Blessed weapon or ammunition, that creature’s speed is reduced  by 10 feet until the end of their next turn. Additionally, they cannot take reactions until the end of their next turn.

### Brutal (A)
Designed to open wide wounds, such as with a broad-bladed arrowhead, brutal ammunition works like a brutal melee weapon.

### Incendiary (A)
When you hit a creature with an Incendiary weapon or ammunition, the target takes an additional 1d4 fire damage.

### Silvered (A)
Attacks you make with silvered weapons or ammunition count as magical for the purpose of overcoming resistance and immunity to non-magical atta
