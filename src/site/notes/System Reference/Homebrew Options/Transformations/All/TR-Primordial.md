The city dwellers raise their eyes to a floating figure barely glimpsed through the smog-filled sky. Their cries ring out as the figure, wreathed in flame, clenches a fist, causing the earth to tremble violently. The crushing weight of water is the last sensation the people know, as their filthy streets are washed clean.

The primordial throws her head back as she exhales a gout of flame. Her charred skin rapidly heals as she wades free of the molten lava, laughing all the way. Her companions look on in horror as she calls to them, “I have heard it. I heard the song of creation!”

Primordials are born when a humanoid absorbs a spark of primordial chaos. The primordial forces are the purest building blocks of creation, and a fostered spark quickly grows to an all-consuming flame. Mastering the elements requires unlearning the limitations of mortality, a process that spurs rapid transformation.

## Becoming a Primordial
There are several ways for a mortal to consume a primordial spark, but continuing to become an elemental takes concentrated effort. A mortal might be born with an elemental spark, gifted one, or they could gain one by consuming the power of an elemental. Once acquired, one must spend a great deal of time contemplating and understanding the spark to unlock its full potential.

The process of attaining elemental mastery is danger- ous. The slightest slip in control can cause devastation on a massive scale. Such facts are why isolated individuals like druids, monks, or rangers are most likely to see the transformation through to its end.

## Transformation Features
A Primordial has the following transformation features:

### Prerequisites
**Ability Scores:** Constitution 13 or higher 
**Roleplay:** Either through ritual, defeating a greater Elemental being, or some other means, you must consume a Primordial Spark.

Some of your abilities require your target to make a saving throw to resist their effects. The saving throw DC is calculated as follows:
>Transformation Save DC = 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Constitution modifier.

### Level Milestones
The following are examples of possible level milestones for the Primordial:
- Defeat and absorb the power of a greater elemental
- Claim an elemental node
- Make an alliance with a being from one of the [[Places/Cosmology/Planes of Existance/Inner Planes/Elemental Planes/Elemental Planes|Elemental Planes]]
- Use your powers to defeat an encroaching civilization
- Free an imprisoned or indentured elemental creature

### Transformation level 1

Starting at 1st level, you gain the following Transforma- tion Boons and this level’s Transformation Flaw.

#### Transformation Boon: Elemental Form
Your Constitution increases by 2 and your Wisdom score increases by 1. An ability score cannot be increased beyond 16 this way.

You become an Elemental in addition to any other creature types you are. Spells and abilities that affect Elementals of a specific CR do not affect you.

#### Transformation Boon: Primordial Affinity
While able to control all elements, your Primordial birth was sparked by one particular element: your Primordial Affinity. Your body is infused with malleable elemental energy. You must choose an element below and gain all the benefits of that element:

##### Air
You have resistance to lightning damage. In addition, you can channel the air currents around you to guide a ranged attack. Once on each of your turns, when you make a ranged weapon or ranged spell attack, you can make that attack with advanage. If you are in a location without an air current - such as underwater - this feature has no effect.

##### Earth
You have resistance to poison damage. In addition, whenever you gain temporary hit points, you gain that many plus your proficiency bonus instead.

##### Fire
You have resistance to fire damage. In addition, whenever you deal fire damage, you can add your Constitution modifier to the damage dealt.

##### Water
You have resistance to cold damage. In addition, whenever a creature regains hit points due to a spell or feature you control, you can imbue them with healing elemental energy. The creature regains additional 1d6 hit points. Only one creature who regains hit points from the spell or feature can benefit from this.

#### Transformation Boon: Primordial Affinity (Variant Option)
While able to control all elements, your Primordial birth was sparked by one particular element: your Primordial Affinity. Your body is infused with malleable elemental energy. You must choose an element below and gain all the benefits of that element:

##### Air
You have resistance to lightning damage. In addition, you can channel the air currents around you to guide a ranged attack. Once on each of your turns, when you make a ranged weapon or ranged spell attack, you can make that attack with advanage. If you are in a location without an air current - such as underwater - this feature has no effect.

##### Earth
You have resistance to poison damage. In addition, you learn and can use the Druidcraft, Mold Earth and Thornwhip cantrips.

##### Fire
You have resistance to fire damage. In addition, you can summon the primordial fire to infuse your weapon. Once on each of your turns, you can add fire damage to a meele attack equal to your Proficiancy bonus. A flammable object hit by this attack ignites if it isn't being worn or carried.

##### Water
You have resistance to cold damage. In addition, whenever a creature regains hit points within 10ft. of you, you can imbue them with healing elemental energy. The creature regains additional 1d6 hit points. Only one creature who regains hit points from the same spell or feature can benefit from this. 

#### Transformation Flaw: Planar Binding
Your body and soul are bound to a primordial plane of existence. You have disadvantage on death saving throws as the plane attempts to pull you back to it. If you would be killed, your soul is taken back to a plane of existence of the GM’s choice. This plane is your new home, and you become an NPC under the GM’s control.

If you are on the primordial plane responsible for your transformation, this flaw has no effect.

### Transformation level 2
At 2nd level, you can pick one of the following Transformation Boons. In addition, you also gain this level’s Transformation Flaw.

#### Transformation Boon: Dual Nature
You can choose to add a second elemental source from the Primordial Affinity Boon to add to your form. When you do so, you gain the associated benefits of your new element.

#### Transformation Boon: Elemental Surge
You can channel pure elemental energy into a concentrated bolt of an element of your choice. You can use these features a number of times equal to your Constitution modifier, regaining all expended uses upon completing a long rest. On your turn, as an action you can choose one of the choices below:

##### Lightning Strike
You can make a special ranged attack targeting a creature within 60 feet. You are proficient with this attack, which uses your Constitution modifier. On a hit, this attack deals 3d8 + your Constitution modifier lightning damage. You can then use a bonus action to target another creature with 30 feet of the first target with the same attack. Increase the damage by 1d8 for each transformation level above 2.

##### Earth Shard
You can force a creature within 30 feet to make a Constitution saving throw. On a failed save, the creature takes bludgeoning damage equal to 3d6 + your Constitution modifier, or half as much on a successful save. Increase the damage by 1d6 for each transformation level above 2.

You also gain temporary hit points equal to half the damage dealt.

##### Flame Wave
Each creature in a 15-foot cone originating in your square must make a Dexterity saving throw. On a failed save, creatures in the area take fire damage equal to 2d8 + your Constitution modifier. Increase the damage by 1d8 for each transformation level above 2.

##### Aquatic Rejuvenation
Choose a creature you can see within 60 feet of you. The creature regains a number of hit points equal to 2d8 + your Constitution modifier. Increase the amount of hit points regained by 1d8 for each transformation level above 2.



#### Transformation Boon: Call The Four
You can use your action to summon or repel elemental forces around you, causing one of the following effects of your choice:
- You create a 15-foot radius globe of breathable air around you. Creatures can pass freely in or out of the globe, but other elemental forces like water or fire cannot. Alternatively, you can choose to banish all air from inside the globe. This globe lasts for 10 minutes, and you must concentrate on it (as per concentrating to maintain a spell).
- You can conjure up to 50 pounds of loose earth at a point within 30 feet of you. Alternatively, you can shape the earth and stone within 15 feet of you. If affecting dirt or stone on the ground, you can cause it to become difficult terrain.
- All flammable objects not worn or wielded within 30 feet of you to burst into flame for 1 minute. Alternatively, all nonmagical flames within 30 feet of you are immediately extinguished.
- You can conjure up to 10 gallons of water at a point within 30 feet of you or cause the water to fall like rain in a 30-foot area for 1 minute. Alternatively, you can choose to repel water within 15 feet of you. This ability has no effect on living creatures but repels mist, rain and creates pockets of air if submerged in water.
    
#### Transformation Flaw: Elemental Appearance
Your appearance has grotesquely transformed. Your eyes might be smoldering embers, water could continuously pour from your mouth or nose, your extremities may crumble like sand, or patches of your skin might fade to transparency. Regardless of your true form, you are horrific to behold. You can suspend this form and manifest the appearance of the humanoid you once were, but this is taxing and requires concentration.

This form is not permanent, and moments of stress are likely to reveal your true nature. Your true form is revealed in the following situations:
- Concentrating on a spell.
- Gaining the unconscious condition.
- Choosing to reveal yourself.
- In events of extreme emotional or physical stress, a GM may call for a Constitution saving throw with a DC of their choosing to see if you maintain your humanoid form.
    
Non-chaotic creatures that witness your true form become hostile to you, unless the GM decides otherwise.
    
### Transformation level 3
At 3rd level, you can pick one of the following Transfor- mation Boons or pick a boon from a lower level that you meet the prerequisites for. In addition, you also gain this level’s Transformation Flaw.
    
#### Transformation Boon: Primeval Body
Your transformation to an elemental form has changed your body entirely. You no longer need to sleep, breathe, or eat. You also gain resistance to bludgeoning, piercing, and slashing damage from nonmagical attacks.
    
#### Transformation Boon: Aura Of Awakening
You emit an aura of power that awakens the elemental forces in your companions. When you first gain this feature, choose one of the options below. You may change the aura you emit upon completing a long rest.

##### Light as Air
Whenever you or a friendly creature within 10 feet of you makes a Dexterity saving throw, the creature gains a bonus equal to your Constitution modifier. You must be conscious to grant this bonus.

##### Forged in Fire
While you are conscious, whenever you or a friendly creature within 10 feet of you deals damage with a melee weapon attack, they deal additional fire damage equal to your Constitution modifier. You must be conscious to grant this bonus.

##### Heart of Stone
At the beginning of your turn, you and each creature of your choice within 10 feet of you gain temporary hit points equal to your Constitution modifier. While a creature has temporary hit points gained in this manner and are not incapacitated, they cannot be moved or knocked prone, unless they choose to be. You must be conscious to grant this bonus.

##### Spring of Life
Each unconscious , non-sleeping creature of your choice within 10 feet of you regains 1 hit point at the beginning of their turn. You must be conscious to grant this bonus.

#### Transformation Boon: Master Of Many
**Prerequisite: Dual Nature**
You can choose to add a third elemental source to your form. When you do so, you gain the associated benefits of your new element from Primordial Affinity in addition to your current source benefits.

#### Transformation Flaw: Force Of Nature
You are losing your connection to societal norms. The needs of civilization, community, and morals pale in comparison to the [[Places/Cosmology/Planes of Existance/Inner Planes/Elemental Planes/Elemental Planes|elemental chaos]] roiling within you. Whenever you complete a long rest, if you are within civilization, you do not regain any hit dice or lose any levels of exhaustion. In these circumstances, the GM decides if a location is considered civilized or not. Alternatively, the GM can decide that a park or grove within a city is sufficient.

### Transformation level 4
You can pick one of the following Transformation Boons or pick a boon from a lower level that you meet the prerequisites for. In addition, you also gain this level’s Transformation Flaw.

#### Transformation Boon: Potent Aura
**Prerequisite: Aura of Awakening**
Creatures of your choice within 10 feet of you gain resistance to lightning, fire, poison, and cold damage.

#### Transformation Boon: Energy Flow
As a bonus action, you can burst into a shower of elemental material then materialize somewhere else. You magically teleport up to 30 feet to an unoccupied space you can see, along with any equipment you are wearing or carrying. Moving in this way does not provoke opportunity attacks. You can use this ability a number of times equal to your Constitution modifier. You regain all expended uses at the end of a long rest. After teleporting, you can choose one of the following:

##### Swift Assault
You can immediately make a weapon attack. If you make a ranged attack, you do not have disadvantage if a hostile creature is within 5 feet.

##### Spark Storm
Each creature within 10 feet of you must succeed on a Dexterity saving throw. On a failed save creatures take 2d6 fire damage.

##### Boulderous Hide
Choose a damage type. Until the start of your next turn, you have resistance to that damage type.

##### Sea Mother’s Tether
A thin tether of water links you to a creature within 30 feet for 1 minute. While tethered, if the creature would take damage, you can choose to take that damage instead. Additionally, if you would be damaged, the tethered creature can choose to take that damage instead. This damage cannot be reduced or prevented in any way.

#### Transformation Boon: Elemental Mastery
**Prerequisite: Master of Many**
You gain the fourth elemental source to your form. When you do so, you gain the associated benefits of your new element from Primordial Affinity.

Additionally, you can summon the four elements to wreath you in power. Whenever a creature hits you with a melee attack, you can use your reaction to force it to make a Dexterity saving throw, taking 8d6 damage of a type of your choice from cold, fire, lightning or bludgeoning, or half as much on a successful save. You can use this feature a number of times equal to your Constitution modifier, regaining all uses upon completing a long rest. Until the end of your following turn, your Primordial Affinity feature has one of the following additions:

##### Air
You have advantage on all ranged weapon and ranged spell attacks instead of only one.

##### Earth
At the beginning of your turn you gain a num- ber of temporary hit points equal to your character level. 

##### Fire
At the beginning of your turn, each creature of your choice within 5 feet of you takes 2d6 fire damage.

##### Water
Whenever a creature regains hit points due to a spell or feature you control that creature regains an addi- tional number of hit points equal to your character level.

#### Transformation Flaw: Pull Of Chaos
Your new native plane attempts to pull you to it, laying claim to your form. Whenever you roll a natural 1 on a saving throw against a magical spell or ability, you take 1d6 force damage per two character levels in addition to any other damage or effects you would suffer, as your native plane attempts to unbind you from the Material Plane. For example, a 6th-level character would take 3d6 force damage. This damage ignores resistances and immunities.
