|01-05          |01-08  |01-09  |01-11  |Your body starts to become formless. You have disadvantage on Dexterity saving throws.                                                                                                                  |
|06-10          |09-16  |10-18  |12-22  |You start to become rigid and brittle, making resting less effective. When you consume a hit dice, you do not add your constitution modifier to the result.                                             |
|11-15          |17-24  |19-27  |23-33  |Your body starts sweating a viscous substance that hardens quickly. You cannot doff armour or change clothes. Dropping, stowing, or interacting with an object requires an action.                      |
|16-24          |25-32  |28-36  |34-43  |You immediately throw up a thick, black ichor and begin feeling nauseous. You do not benefit from the effects of any food, drink, or potions consumed.                                                  |
|25-32          |33-40  |37-45  |44-52  |You are only able to form one-word sentences in a guttural voice you do not recognise. You can still cast spells with verbal components.                                                                |
|43-40          |35-48  |46-54  |53-61  |Your legs become unresponsive and difficult to move. Your movement speed decreases by 10 feet.                                                                                                          |
|41-48          |42-56  |55-63  |62-70  |Your body begins fighting against any form you take. You cannot make reactions.                                                                                                                         |
|49-56          |57-64  |64-72  |71-77  |Your arms periodically have a will of their own, causing your reaction speed to slow while you regain control of them. You have disadvantage on Dexterity ability checks to determine initiative order. |
|57-64          |65-72  |73-80  |78-84  |Your skin quivers and shifts, while your appearance constantly changes. Every 30 seconds a defining feature of appearance changes, such as hair colour, facial features, or body proportions.           |
|65-81          |73-83  |81-89  |85-91  |Nothing happens.                                                                                                                                                                                        |
|82-91          |84-92  |90-95  |92-96  |You become immune to the grappled and restrained conditions.                                                                                                                                            |
|92-100         |93-100 |96-100 |97-100 |If you would gain hit points from a spell or ability other than your own, you gain that many hit points plus your Constitution modifier instead.                                                        |
