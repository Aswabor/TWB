Gifts of Damnation – Contracts

Gifts of Damnation are named after the benefits you can offer mortals in exchange for their souls. As the name suggests, these gifts offer mortals only short-term benefits and usually end in tragedy. To a Fiend, however, these gifts represent the powers you can gain by offering certain contracts and gaining the power of a soul. You can choose gifts that are thematic for your character, or that you like the benefits of, providing you meet the requirements.

giFt oF unBridled poWer

Prerequisite: 4th Level of Fiend Transformation

Upon completing a short rest, you can spend 1 Hit Die and regain any number of spell slots whose total is equal to or less than the result of the Hit Dice. If you do, you suffer psychic damage equal to the number of spell slot levels you regained. You cannot use this ability again until you complete a long rest.

giFt oF unFettered glory

When you hit a creature with a melee attack or melee spell attack, you can add your Charisma modifier to the damage dealt.

giFt oF joyous youtH

At the beginning of your turn, if you have no remaining Hit Dice, you can choose to make a DC 10 Charisma saving throw. On a success, you regain 1 spent Hit Die. If you fail, you suffer 1d6 psychic damage.

giFt oF liBerAting Freedom

Prerequisite: 2nd Level of Fiend Transformation

As a bonus action, you can manifest a pair of leathery wings. You gain a fly speed equal to your current speed. These wings recede if you dismiss them as a bonus action on your turn, or if you  
are knocked unconscious. You cannot manifest your wings while wearing heavy armour. You can manifest your wings while wearing medium or light armour if it is made to accommodate them.

giFt oF unsurpAssed Fortune

Whenever a creature makes an attack roll, skill check, or saving throw within 20 feet, after the GM has rolled but before they have determined the result, you can use your reaction to roll a d20. If you roll a 10 or higher, the attack roll, saving throw, or skill check immediately fails. You cannot do this again until you complete a long rest.

giFt oF unconditionAl love

Prerequisite: 3rd Level of Fiend Transformation

Whenever a creature fails a Charisma saving throw due to a spell or magical ability you control, you can use your reaction to gain temporary hit points equal to 1d10 + your Character’s level.  
You cannot do this again until you complete a short rest.

giFt oF expAnsive knoWledge

Prerequisite: 4th Level of Fiend Transformation

When you complete this contract for the first time, you learn additional spells from the  
cleric, warlock, or wizard spell list equal to your Charisma modifier. You must have a spell slot level equal to or greater than each of these spells. While you have the effects of this contract and no other contract active, you know these spells in addition to your total Spells Known.

giFt oF prodigious tAlent

Prerequisite: 2nd Level of Fiend Transformation

Choose two of your skill proficiencies. Your proficiency bonus is doubled for any ability check you make that uses either of the chosen proficiencies. This ability cannot double your proficiency bonus on a skill whose proficiency bonus is already being doubled.

giFt oF second cHAnces

Prerequisite: 3rd Level of Fiend Transformation

If you are reduced to 0 hit points, you can use your reaction to roll a Hit Die. If you do, your hit point total becomes the Hit Die result instead. You can’t use this feature again until you complete a long rest.
