A lone figure clad in burnished steel greets the roaring infantry as they charge through the breach in the castle’s walls. In a flash of black mist, the figure appears in front of the soldiers, striking them down with inhuman speed.

Candlelight flickers as a hooded adviser leans over an ornate throne, whispering machinations into her lord’s ensnared mind. The chamber erupts in commotion as the lord announces further powers be granted to the resident merchant’s guild.

Vampires are creatures of cursed blood and tragic existence. Exquisite food, a warm summer’s breeze, and growing old with loved ones are all luxuries a Vampire will never experience. Unable to enjoy many of the fineries of life as they once knew it, Vampires often become bitter creatures, filled with hate for everything they once loved.

## Becoming a Vampire
Vampires are spawned into the world when a mortal contracts the Sanguine Curse, dies, and is reborn undead. There are a variety of ways to contract the curse. A Vampire may have offered their blood to a loyal servant, powerful ally, or loved one they wished to elevate. More commonly, a Vampire may have bitten you, and you survived the Vampire’s attack long enough to contract  
the Sanguine Curse before perishing and being reborn. Other methods include ancient and dark magic, as well as powerful but cursed magical artifacts. Regardless of how you have become a Vampire, you should discuss with your GM what type of Vampire you would like to become, and how it can be implemented in the campaign.

## Transformation Features
A Vampire has the following transformation features:

### Prerequisites
**Ability Scores:** Dexterity 13  
**Roleplay Milestones:** You must have contracted the Sanguine Curse, whether by being bitten by a Vampire, offered their blood, completing the Sanguine Ritual, or by another plausible method. Discuss with your GM how you can achieve  
this in-game.

Some of your abilities require your target to make a saving throw to resist their effects. The saving throw DC is calculated as follows:
>Transformation Save DC = 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Dexterity or Charisma modifier

### Level Milestones
The following are examples of possible level milestones for the Vampire:
- Establish a coven of vampire spawn.
- Drink the blood of a legendary monster.
- Learn the great secrets of vampirism from a Vampire Lord.
- Learn to embrace your Hideous Form and lose the ability to conceal it.
- Discover the lost crypts of an ancient vampire and consume its essence.
    

### Transformation Level 1
Starting at 1st level, you gain the following Transformation Boons and this level’s Transformation Flaw.

#### Transformation Boon: Blood Fury
You have become possessed by the thirst that grips all Vampires. In combat, this thirst drives you into an insatiable frenzy of bloodshed. Whenever you deal combat damage with an unarmed strike or a melee/ranged weapon to a target that can bleed, and is not undead or a construct, you gain one Fury Point. You may only have a maximum of 4 Fury Points at any time. Upon completing a short or long rest, the number of Fury Points you have is reset to 0. These points are used by certain abilities that you can learn through your transformation levels.

##### Blood Fury Abilities
You can spend Fury Points (FP) to use the following abilities. The entries below detail their names, Fury Points cost in parentheses, and features:

###### Fanged Bite (1FP)
On your turn, immediately after you take the attack action, you can use your bonus action to make a special unarmed bite attack. You can use your Dexterity modifier instead of strength to hit with this attack. This attack deals piercing damage equal to 1d4 + your Strength or Dexterity modifier. The target must then succeed at a Constitution saving throw or take 2d6 necrotic damage. You regain hit point equal to the necrotic damage dealt this way. This attack generates 1 Fury Point as normal. If this attack reduces a humanoid creature of size Medium or smaller to 0 hit points, you gain 3 Fury Points instead.

###### Calculated Strike (1FP)
When you hit with a melee weapon attack, you may use this ability before damage is dealt. If you do so, you may add 1d6 of the same damage as your weapon to the damage result. If this ability is used, no Fury Points are generated for this attack.

###### Vampiric Mist (2FP)
As a bonus action, you can disappear in a puff of shadowy mist and teleport up to 30 feet to an unoccupied space you can see.

###### Unearthly Reflexes (1FP)
After you have rolled a Dexterity saving throw, but before the GM has determined the result, you can use your reaction and take half damage on a failed save, and no damage on a successful one.

###### Deathly Horror (3FP)
As a bonus action, you can emit a ghastly distortion of your true form. A creature of your choice within 30 feet of you must succeed on a Wisdom saving throw or become Frightened of you for 1 minute. A creature can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success. A creature that succeeds on its saving throw is immune to this ability for 24 hours.

#### Transformation Boon: Undead Form
Your Dexterity score increases by 2 and your Charisma score increases by 1. An ability score cannot be increased beyond 16 this way. In addition, your creature type changes to undead. Spells and abilities that state effects or [[System Reference/Conditions|conditions]] specifically regarding Undead of a specific CR have no effect on you. If a spell or ability other than your own would cause you to gain Hit Points, you gain that many temporary Hit Points instead. If you are reduced to 0 hit points and fall unconscious as a result, any healing you receive will stabilize you and leave you on 1 hit point and unconscious. Furthermore, you cannot die from old age and you do not require air, food or drink.

##### Feeding
Transcended beyond mortal needs, vampires do not need to eat. However, the gripping nature of their curse requires them to feed on the fresh blood of humanoids. A task they undertake with delight.

On your turn, as an action, you can make an unarmed bite attack against an unconcious, restrained or charmed humanoid. If you do so, the target is drained for 1 pint of blood and bears a bite mark on the location you bit them. This attack does not wake sleeping creatures or end the effect of spells and abilities. A creature bitten this way gains a level of exhaustion, which can only be removed with the use of a greater restoration spell.

A vampire that does not feed within the required time goes into an unconscious feeding frenzy, under the GM’s control. The next time they sleep or enter a trance they attack all nearby living creatures and attempt to feed on them. A vampire remains in this state until they have drained a creature completely (killing them), at which point the vampire falls unconscious for 4 hours.

#### Transformation Flaw: The Sanguine Curse
The sanguine curse has taken a hold on you. As a result you gain the following features:
- You cannot enter a residence you do not own without an invitation from one of the occupants. If you enter a residence involuntarily such as by being dragged into one, you take 1d10 psychic damage at the start of your turn while you are inside it.
- You gain Darkvision (60 ft.) if you do not already have it.
- While in sunlight, you have disadvantage on attack rolls and ability checks.
- You must feed every 7 days.

### Transformation Level 2
Starting at 2nd level, you can pick one of the following Transformation Boons. You also gain this level’s Transformation Flaw.

#### Transformation Boon: Dread Knight Combat Training
You become trained in the martial ways of the Dread Knights. As a bonus action, you may enter, exit, or change combat stances. While in a combat stance, you gain the features of that stance. Additionally you may use Dexterity instead of Strength for the attack and damage rolls of any melee weapon with the slashing damage type.

##### Offensive
While in this stance, you deal an additional amount of damage with your melee weapon equal to the number of Fury Points you currently possess (minimum of 1).

##### Defensive
While in this stance, you gain a bonus to your AC equal to half the number of Fury Points you currently possess (minimum of 1).

##### Accuracy
While in this stance, you gain a bonus to hit with your weapon attacks equal to half the number of Fury Points you currently possess (minimum of 1).

#### Transformation Boon: Sanguine Magic
**Prerequisite: The ability to cast spells.**
Your curse corrupts the magic you cast. Whenever you deal non-necrotic damage with a spell or cantrip, you can choose to deal necrotic damage instead of that spell’s normal damage type. Furthermore, whenever you deal damage with a spell or cantrip, you gain one Fury Point (maximum of 1 per turn).

Additionally, you gain the following Blood Fury abilities:

##### Cast in Blood (1 FP)
The next time you cast a damage-dealing cantrip, you can add your charisma modifier to the damage you deal.

##### Sanguine Spellbinding (3 FP)
The next time a creature makes a Charisma, Intelligence, or Wisdom saving throw against a spell you have cast, it has disadvantage. If a spell affects multiple creatures at the same time, you choose which creature is affected.

#### Transformation Boon: Shapechanger
You can use an action to polymorph into a Tiny bat or back into your normal form. While in bat form, you gain the following features:
- Your walking speed is 5 feet, and you have a flying speed of 30 feet.
- If you have sunlight hypersensitivity, it is reduced to sunlight sensitivity: while in sunlight, you have disadvantage on attack rolls and ability checks, but take no damage from direct contact with sunlight.
- While in bat form, you can’t speak. Any object you are holding or armour you are wearing merges into your bat form or immediately drops to the ground. The GM may decide if they feel the object cannot merge.
- If you become unconscious in bat form, you revert back to your vampiric form.

Additionally, you can use an action to turn into mist. Whilst in mist form, you gain the following features:
- You cannot take any actions, speak, or manipulate objects.
- You are weightless, have a flying speed of 20 feet, can hover, and can enter a hostile creature’s space and stop there.
- In addition, if air can fit through a space, then you can as well. You cannot pass through liquid, and this does not give you the ability to cross running water.
- You have advantage on Strength, Dexterity, and Constitution saving throws, and are immune to all non magical damage, except any damage you take from sunlight.
- Any object you are holding or armour you are wearing merges into your mist form or immediately drops to the ground. The GM may decide if they feel the object cannot merge.
- If you become unconscious in mist form, you revert back to your vampiric form.

#### TransformaTion Boon: Night Stalker
You gain proficiency in Stealth. If you already have proficiency in Stealth, then your proficiency bonus is doubled when making Stealth ability checks.

Additionally, you can attempt to hide even when you are only lightly obscured, including dim light.

You also gain a climb speed equal to your walking speed. You can climb difficult surfaces, including upside down on ceilings, without needing to make an ability check.

#### Transformation Flaw: Hideous Appearance
Your appearance has greatly altered from its original features. The first signs were the fangs that started to protrude from your upper row of teeth. You have no reflection in mirrors or other reflective surfaces. With dry, pale skin and occasional burns from the sun, you can hide your true appearance by concentrating on your pre-vampirism appearance. However, the following situations can reveal your true appearance:
- Concentrating on a spell.
- Gaining the unconscious condition.
- Entering hallowed ground.
- Taking damage from being exposed to sunlight or free-flowing water.
- Choosing to reveal your true self.

In events of extreme emotional or physical stress, a GM may call for a Constitution saving throw with a DC of their choosing to see if you maintain your humanoid form.

### Transformation Level 3
Starting at 3rd level, you can pick one of the following Transformation Boons, or pick a boon from a lower level that you meet the prerequisites for. You also gain this level’s Transformation Flaw.

#### Transformation Boon: Cruel Riposte
Whenever a creature within 5 feet of you makes an attack against you, you may use your reaction to make a melee weapon attack against the attacking creature. You may use this feature a number of times equal to your Dexterity modifier (minimum of 1). You regain all expended uses of this feature when you complete a long rest.

#### Transformation Boon: Creatures Of The Night
Once per long rest, you can magically call to your aid 2d4 swarms of bats or 2d4 swarms of rats. When outdoors, you can summon 2d4 wolves instead of swarms of rats. These creatures arrive at the end of your next turn at a destination of the GM’s choice within 30 feet of you, and they are under your control. They act directly after you in the initiative order and remain for 1 hour, until you die, or until you dismiss them with a bonus action. You cannot use this ability if you are exposed to direct sunlight.

#### Transformation Boon: Captivating Glance
You gain proficiency in Deception and Persuasion. If you are already proficient in one of these skills, then your proficiency bonus is doubled for ability checks using that skill. If you have or ever gain double proficiency in one or both of these skills, you gain +2 for that skill instead.

Additionally, your thoughts cannot be read by any means.

#### TransformaTion Boon: Improved Shapechanger
**Prerequisite: Shapechanger**
When you use your Shapechanger ability, you may also take on the form of a dire wolf. While in dire wolf form you gain the following features:
- Your movement speed changes to 50 feet. If you have sunlight hypersensitivity, it is reduced to sunlight sensitivity: while in sunlight, you have disadvantage on attack rolls and ability checks, but take no damage from direct contact with sunlight.
- While in dire wolf form, you can’t speak. Any object you are holding or [[System Reference/Homebrew Options/Armor/Armor|armor]] you are wearing merges into your wolf form or immediately drops to the ground. The GM may decide if they feel the object cannot merge.
- If you become unconscious in dire wolf form, you revert back to your vampiric form.

Additionally, you gain the ability to use Fanged Bite while in animal form. The piercing damage for your Fanged Bite changes based on your form. While in bat form you deal 1 piercing damage, and while in dire wolf form you deal 2d6 piercing damage.

While in mist form you may cast the spell fog cloud once without expending a spell slot and without using verbal, somatic, or material components. You regain the ability to cast this spell when you finish a long rest.

#### Transformation Flaw: Greater Sanguine Curse
Your curse has taken a stronger hold on you. As a result you gain the following features:
- You take 1d10 acid damage if you end your turn in running water.
- You gain superior Darkvision (120 ft.) if you do not already have it.
- You take 1d10 radiant damage when you start your turn in sunlight.
- You must feed every 3 days.
    
### Transformation Level 4
Starting at 4th level, you can pick one of the following Transformation Boons, or pick a boon from a lower level that you meet the prerequisites for. You also gain this level’s Transformation Flaw.
    
#### Transformation Boon: Grim Executioner
**Prerequisite: Dread Knight Combat Training.**
You have mastered the martial techniques of the Dread Knight. Whenever you roll a critical hit with a melee or ranged weapon, and the target has 50 or fewer hit points, you kill the target outright. If your target has more than 50 hit points, you deal an extra 6d6 damage. This damage is of the same type as your weapon.

#### Transformation Boon: Beguiler’s Entrancement
**Prerequisite: Captivating Glance.**
Once per long rest, you gain the ability to manipulate the mind of a humanoid with your sanguine magic. You can use an action to make an incapacitated humanoid charmed by you for 24 hours or until you target a different humanoid with this ability. If you use this ability on the same target for 30 unbroken days, the target becomes permanently charmed by you.

You may use this ability on another humanoid once you have permanently charmed the previous humanoid. You can have a maximum number of enthralled humanoids equal to your Charisma Modifier (minimum of 1). If the number of enthralled humanoids exceeds your Charisma modifier for any reason, you lose connection to all of them.

This charm effect can be removed with the remove curse spell, or any other spell or ability with similar effects.

#### Transformation Boon: Regenerate
You regain 10 hit points at the start of your turn if you have at least 1 hit point remaining, and are not in sunlight or over running water.

If you take radiant damage or damage from holy water, this ability does not function at the start of your next turn.

#### Transformation Boon: Innate Sangromancy
**Prerequisite: Sanguine Magic**
You know all Sangromancy Spells. When casting a spell using Sangromancy, you may use FP instead of spending hit dice. Treat these FP as 1d12 hit dice. When you cast a spell in this way you do not generate FP from Sanguine Magic and you may choose a single effect to apply to the spell by spending additional FP:

##### Beguiling Spell (2 FP)
When a creature fails their saving throw against this spell, they are also charmed by you until the end of your next turn.

##### Shadow Spell (2 FP)
When a creature fails their saving throw against this spell, they are unable to perceive you until the end of your next turn, except by magical means.

##### Withering Spell (3 FP)
When you cast a spell that deals necrotic damage, it deals an additional 1d8 necrotic damage per spell level. A creature damaged by this spell cannot take reactions until the end of your next turn.

##### Vampiric Spell (3 FP)
When you cast a spell that deals necrotic damage, you heal for up to half the amount of damage dealt.

#### Transformation Flaw: Stake To Heart
Whenever you’re attacked by a creature with a wooden or silvered weapon, if they score a natural 20 to hit, and you have 50 hit points or less, they manage to lodge their weapon into your heart and you become paralyzed for 1 hour or until the weapon is removed, whichever is greater.
