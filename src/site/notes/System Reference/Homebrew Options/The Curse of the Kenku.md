This curse did three things;

1. Kenku's wings withered and fell to the earth, binding them forever.
    
2. Since the plan to steal from their master involved ingenuity and skill, Grazz't took away the Kenku's spark of creativity.
    
3. Finally, to make sure the Kenku could never divulge any secrets they learn, Grazz't took away their voices.

However, no being can truly destroy ingrained powers and parts of a soul. Grazz't simply concentrated these powers, and coalesced them as motes of energy and spirit, scattering them across the world. It is said that a Kenku can find one of these motes, and unlock some of the abilities that were torn away from them so many ages ago. This story is passed down upon Kenku tribes, and almost every Kenku knows it.
