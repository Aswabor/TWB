This curse did three things;

1. Kenku's wings withered and fell to the earth, binding them forever.
    
2. Since the plan to steal from their master involved ingenuity and skill, Grazz't took away the Kenku's spark of creativity.
    
3. Finally, to make sure the Kenku could never divulge any secrets they learn, Grazz't took away their voices.

However, no being can truly destroy ingrained powers and parts of a soul. Grazz't simply concentrated these powers, and coalesced them as motes of energy and spirit, scattering them across the world. It is said that a Kenku can find one of these motes, and unlock some of the abilities that were torn away from them so many ages ago. This story is passed down upon Kenku tribes, and almost every Kenku knows it.

<!--[[System Reference/Homebrew Options/Gifts of the Motes|Gifts of the Motes]]-->

### The Mote of Flight:
On this battlefield of boiling blood 
there walks a thing oh so far from god
it wanders and searches far and wide 
for things to put on, his iron hide
Within it there lies the mote of Flight
Woe to those that are caught in its blight

### The Mote of Creativity:
On a mountaintop so high and Cold
there lies a city long forgotten
where a treasure taken from the bold
stored among those frozen and rotten
here waits The mote of creativity
taken away for a falsity

### The Mote of Speach:
On howling wind and sunless plight
there the voices of thousands scream
over black sands they'r swept away
none alive now that know today
that they once sang as in a dream
the mote of speech now only fright
