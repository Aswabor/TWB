# Madness
## Table 1
Alternative “Indefinite Madness” Table – Better described as a new onset psychiatric disability.

Permanent effects last until cured by greater restoration or similar magic. Even when cured there are lingering effects. When afflicted, roll on the table (1d10) or the DM can choose one of the following most appropriate for the PC or situation.

1.  Twitching. You develop uncontrollable muscle spasms/tremors when under stress. You gain disadvantage on all dexterity related skills, saves, and checks (Acrobatics, Sleight of Hand, Stealth) and gain a -2 on all ranged attacks. When dashing roll 1d4. On a 1 you fall prone halfway through the dash.

Lingering effect if cured: You have a permanent tic of the DM’s choice (no effect on stats)

2. Paranoia. You gain a general distrust of everyone around you, including close friends. When you see two others in conversation you assume they are plotting against you or talking poorly about you. You view innocent remarks as personal attacks. You gain a -2 to Charisma and disadvantage on persuasion and insight. Once per day the DM can force you to make a DC 15 insight check else treat one chosen NPC or PC as hostile for 1 minute, or until they succeed on a DC 20 Persuasion check.

Lingering effect if cured: You gain the trait “I am slow to trust others around me and do not make friends easily.”

3. Phobia. You develop an irrational fear and when affected by that fear develop a paralyzing impending sense of doom. Roll on list or DM may choose something appropriate to the situation which caused your phobia (battle, heights, animals, insects, closed-in spaces, being alone, being touched, storms, darkness, fire, water, social situations, loud noises, etc). When in a situation with this phobia roll a DC 15 Wisdom saving throw. On a fail you are frozen with fear - you are incapacitated for 1d4 rounds or until the situation resolves. Repeat the save each turn when appropriate. On a success you are frightened for 1d4 rounds or until the situation resolves. Repeat the save each turn when appropriate.

Lingering effect if cured: You gain the trait “I have an extreme dislike of X and avoid it whenever possible” where X is the cause of the phobia.

4. Anxiety Attacks. At the start of each battle and once per day, the DM can cause you to roll a DC 20 Con save. On a fail, for the next 5 minutes you have heart palpitations, severe chest pain, and feel as if you are choking. You visibly sweat and tremble. You are at disadvantage on all attacks, skill checks, and saving throws. If you fail by 5 or more you are also incapacitated but may repeat the save each turn to lose the incapacitated condition.

Lingering effect if cured: You continue to have panic attacks but can prevent them for 24 hours if you meditate for 30 minutes.

5. Triskaidekaphobia. You develop a terrible fear of the number 13. Treat all rolls of 13 as a natural 1. DM - work in some way where there are 13 of something present that leads to the critical fail (leaves, stones, bricks, gems, chairs, etc). Anytime another player rolls a 13 (on the dice, not with modifiers) you must consider them hostile for that round.

Lingering effect if cured: You gain the trait “I have an extreme dislike of the number 13 and avoid it whenever possible.”

6. Auditory Hallucinations. You hear sounds and voices that others do not hear. Some you recognize and others you do not. You struggle keeping the real noises around you and the hallucinations separate. You gain disadvantage on all Perception checks that rely on sound. You have disadvantage on insight, history, and performance. The DM can cause you to hear something (including intelligible speech) at any time and as many times per day as they wish which your character must treat as real.

Lingering effect if cured: Because you ignored so many auditory hallucinations you gain the trait “I sometimes don’t listen to what others are saying and they often have to repeat themselves.”

7. Visual Hallucinations. You see shapes and sometimes figures that no one else can see that are not physically present, some you recognize and others you do not. You struggle keeping the physical objects and the hallucinations separate especially in lower light. You gain disadvantage on all Perception checks that rely on sight. You gain disadvantage on insight and survival. In bright light you can make a DC 15 Insight check to determine if the figure is real or not. During battle once each turn roll 1d6. On a 1 you must target something that is not real within 15 feet of you. Once each day the DM can cause you to see something frightening (bees, last monster killed coming to haunt you, a worm crawling through your skin, etc) and you must make a DC 15 Insight check or be frightened of the hallucination for 1 round.

Lingering effect if cured: You gain the trait “I am constantly touching things to ensure they are really there.”

8. PTSD. You have extreme and vivid nightmares, are easily startled, and quick to anger. You gain -2 to Wisdom and +4 to initiative. You require 2 more hours to gain the benefits of a long rest and lose the trait “Trance” if you have it (lose the ability to meditate). Every long rest roll 1d4. On a 1 you do not gain any benefits of a long rest and instead gain one level of exhaustion. Once per day the DM can cause you to roll a DC 15 Wis save or treat one nearby person of the DM’s choice as hostile.

Lingering effect if cured: You have a permanent +2 to initiative. You must meditate for 30 minutes prior to sleeping to prevent the sleep disturbances.

9. Depression. Your mind becomes clouded and you cannot focus on anything other than the event that incited your depression. You gain a -2 to Wisdom and Charisma. You have disadvantage on initiative. Each turn in combat roll 1d6. On a 1 you lose your turn. In addition to this, Roll 1d4. On a 1 or 2 you struggle sleeping and must roll 1d4 on every long rest. On a 1 or 2 you do not gain any benefits of the long rest and instead gain 1 level of exhaustion. You cannot gain more than 2 levels of exhaustion in this fashion. On a 3 or 4 you instead require 12 hours of sleep to gain a long rest and lose the trait “Trance” if you have it.

Lingering effect if cured: You have a permanent -2 to initiative.

10. Delusion. Roll 1d6 or choose one of the following delusions and effects (better for groups with strong role-playing skills).

1 or 2: You are convinced you are a lycanthrope and that you must do everything you can to keep it from spreading. Nothing anyone does can convince you otherwise, including receiving a remove curse spell. Each night you must tie yourself up with the strongest material available and do your best to keep at least 1000 feet away from others, to prevent the potential spread of your lycanthrope.

3 or 4: You are convinced that you are the chosen one of prophesy destined to save the world, even if you have not heard of any such prophesy. You become overconfident in your abilities. You gain -2 to Wisdom and disadvantage on persuasion and deception checks.

5 or 6: You are convinced that your entire existence is summarized with a few numbers and sentences on a sheet of paper. You dream of a group of people sitting around a table telling stories and rolling dice, telling your story. You gain the effects of Depression above.

Lingering effect if cured: You continue to have the delusion but it is manageable – you suffer none of the ill effects as you figure you haven’t bitten anyone yet, no one else has heard of the prophesy, or why would anyone really want to sit around and play a game like that.

## Table 2
Roll a d100:

01-05 – You are able to stave off the effects of the madness. You do not gain a permanent effect.

06-45 – The madness has affected you in some way. Roll a d4:

-   On a 1, you have developed a slight tremor in your hands. Reduce your Athletics, Acrobatics, Stealth and Sleight of Hand rolls by 1.
    
-   On a 2, your memory has been affected and you can’t recall information as easily. Reduce your Arcana, History, Investigation, Nature and Religion rolls by 1.
    
-   On a 3, you are not as attuned with the world. Reduce your Animal Handling, Insight, Medicine, and Survival rolls by 1.
    
-   On a 4, your confidence has been shaken and you have developed a stammer. Reduce your Persuasion, Deception, Intimidation and Performance rolls by 1.
    

46-55 – The madness you’ve experienced has distorted your perception of reality. Roll a d2:

-   On a 1, you see things in the shadows that aren’t there. When you aren’t in bright light, you have disadvantage on all Perception rolls that rely on sight.
    
-   On a 2, you are constantly hearing things. You have disadvantage on all Perception rolls that rely on sound.
    

56-65 – The madness has caused you to forget something once important to you. Choose a skill you are proficient in. You are no longer proficient in it.

66-75 – The madness has crept into your subconscious and you have awful night terrors when you sleep. Whenever you take a long rest, roll a d6. On a 1, you do not gain the benefits of a long rest. This includes regaining lost HP, regaining spell slots and any abilities that reset. You do however recover HD, and can switch out spells.

76-85 – The madness has severely distorted your perception of reality. You are no longer sure of what is real and fake. You have disadvantage on all Perception rolls.

86-90 – Your spirit has been broken in some way and you are now more susceptible to danger. Roll a d6 (1=STR, 2=DEX, 3=CON, 4=INT, 5=WIS, 6=CHA). Whichever you roll, reduce that Saving Throw by 1.

91-95 – The madness you’ve experienced has caused you to lose the edge on many of things you were highly trained in. Reduce your proficiency bonus by 1.

96-99 – You have been severely touched by the madness of the Underdark. Roll a d6 and a d2. The d6 determines which stat is affected (see above) and the d2 determines how many points of that stat you lose.

100 – You completely lose your mind and fall unconscious, your mind a slave to one of the Demon Lords. While you aren’t dead, you are far from alive and nothing short of a Greater Restoration spell can break your catatonia. Even if/when you awake, you still suffer the stat and proficiency loss from above.
