# EC-AC System  
## Evasion Class (EC)
Your EC is determined by the type of armor you are wearing - or not wearing (in the case of Unarmored). Consult the Evasion Class Table below to determine your EC.

| Evasion Class table       |                      |
| ------------------------- | -------------------- |
| Unarmored and Light Armor | 10 + Dex Mod         |
| Medium Armor              | 10 + Dex Mod (Max 2) |
| Heavy Armor               | 10                   |

 Anytime a shield grants AC, it also increases your EC by the same amount. This is one way for characters that aren't as nimble to still be able to increase their EC.

## Armor Class (AC)
Your Armor Class (AC) represents how well your character avoids being wounded in battle. Things that contribute to your AC include the armor you wear, the shield you carry, and your Dexterity modifier. Not all characters wear armor or carry shields, however. Without armor or a shield, your character's AC equals 10 + his or her Dexterity modifier. If your character wears armor, carries a shield, or both calculate your AC based on those factors.

---
## Armor Reduction (AR)
When you are hit by an attack that falls within your EC-AC range, you reduce the damage of the attack by an amount equal to your AR value. This represents being partially hit by an attack, failing to evade the attack completely, but also mitigating some of the impact. Regardless of the attack's damage type, you have found a way to avoid some of its damage and it becomes reduced by your AR value.
>Armor Reduction Value: (AC - 10)

## How it Works
In order to better differentiate the different armor options, we've added two new defensive statistics called [[System Reference/Homebrew Options/Armor/EC-AC System#Evasion Class EC|Evasion Class (EC)]] and [[System Reference/Homebrew Options/Armor/EC-AC System#Armor Reduction AR|Armor Reduction (AR)]] that work alongside the existing [[System Reference/Homebrew Options/Armor/EC-AC System#Armor Class AC|Armor Class (AC)]]. Your EC and AC will often be referred to as your EC-AC range that's represented by a couple of numbers. For example, when wearing Plate armor your EC is 10 and your AC is 18, which will be represented as 10-18 and referred to as your EC-AC range.

>When an attack made against you is:
>- above your AC, you are hit and take full damage.
>- below your EC, you evade the hit and take no damage.
>- within your EC-AC range, you are hit but take reduced damage as determined by your AR value.

 

# Getting Into And Out Of Armor
The time i t takes to don o r doff a type o f armor o r a shield is shown in the Donning and Doffing Armor table.

**Don.** This is the time it takes to put on the item. You benefit from its AC only if you take the full time to don it.

**Doff.** This is the time it takes to take off the item. If you have help removing armor, reduce the time by half.

## Donning And Doffing Armor
| Category     | Don        | Doff      |
| ------------ | ---------- | --------- |
| Light Armor  | 1 minute   | 1 minute  |
| Medium Armor | 5 minutes  | 1 minute  |
| Heavy Armor  | 10 minutes | 5 minutes | 
| Shield       | 1 action   | 1 action  |
