## Shield Properties
 ### #S-Property/Bulky
 This shield can be wielded using one or two hands. When wielding this shield with only one hand, your speed is reduced by 10ft and you have DisADV on Dexterity Checks.

---
 ### #S-Property/Deployable
As an action, you can deploy this shield in an unoccupied space within 5ft of you that you can see. While deployed, the shield becomes a 5ft wide wall that grants 3/4 cover to one Medium or smaller creature standing behind it. The shield can be picked up using an action.

---
 ### #S-Property/Defensive
The extra armor this shield provides reduces your offensive capabilities while moving. You make all attack rolls at DisADV if you’ve moved since your last action.

---
 ### #S-Property/Deflecting
You can use your reaction to double your AC bonus from your shield against a ranged attack.

---
 ### #S-Property/Mounted-Defense
 The AC bonus this shield grants you also benefits a Mount you are riding.

---
 ### #S-Property/Offensive
 The damage die of the shield becomes a d8, instead of a d4.

---
 ### #S-Property/Protective
 You can add the shield’s AC bonus to your Dex Saves against effects that cover an area and deal damage.

---
 ### #S-Property/Shield-Wall
This shield grants an additional +1 bonus to your AC while another creature welding a shield with the same property is within 5ft of you and is not Incapacitated. Attempts to Grapple or move through your space are made with DisADV, unless you allow them.

---
 ### #S-Property/Stable
The hand that holds this shield retains enough manual precision to do the following simple tasks: lift, drop, hold, push, or pull an object or creature, open and close a door or containers, make an unarmed strike, or load a ranged weapon with the Ammunition property.

---
 ### #S-Property/Thrown
You can make a ranged weapon attack (range 15/30) using the shield. You use the same ability modifier for this attack and damage roll that you would use for a melee attack with the shield. Once thrown, you are not considered to be wielding the shield until you don it again.
