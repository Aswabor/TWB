- **Mote of Flight.** You have a flying speed equal to your walking speed. You can't use this flying speed if you're wearing medium or heavy [[System Reference/Homebrew Options/Armor/Armor|armor]].
- **Mote of Creativity.** Excitedly, the Kenku looks around their body for a change. However, it sees and feels nothing. Dejectedly, It thinks perhaps the power will manifest soon. But before resting for the night, or going somewhere rather beautiful, the Kenku feels something. Perhaps brought on by boredom or the landscape, it either draws subconsciously or feels the urge to draw. But it stops itself, it's never wanted to draw before. The Kenku's spark of creativity has returned.
- **Mote of Speech.** The Kenku feels a shifting. It almost feels disgusting, like a creature inside of its body. The shifting is located in the throat, and kind of tickles. After a brief odd second, the tickle is gone. The Kenku's voice has returned. (Also, when they do Mimicry to try to confuse a creature, they have advantage on the deception check.)
