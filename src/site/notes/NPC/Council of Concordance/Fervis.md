>***Elemental Demise.*** If the efreeti dies, its body disintegrates into crystalline powder, leaving behind only equipment the efreeti was wearing or carrying.  
>
>***Innate Spellcasting.*** The efreeti's innate spellcasting ability is Charisma (spell save DC 16). The efreeti can innately cast the following spells, without providing material components:

>### Actions
>***Multiattack.*** The efreeti makes two scimitar attacks or uses its Hurl Flame twice.  
>
>***Scimitar.*** *Melee Weapon Attack:* +12 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. *Hit:* 14 (2d6 + 7) slashing damage plus 7 (2d6) fire damage and if the target is not immune to fire, it gains vulnerability to fire damage until the end of the efreeti's next turn.  
>
>***Hurl Flame.*** *Ranged Spell Attack:* +12 to hit, range 120 ft., one target. *Hit:* 17 (5d6) fire damage.  
>
>***Arcing Fireblade (Recharge 5â€“6).*** The efreeti swings its scimitar in a full arc, and every creature within 10 feet of it must succeed on a DC 20 Dexterity saving throw. On a failed saving throw, a creature takes 14 (2d6 + 7) slashing damage plus 7 (2d6) fire damage and if the target is not immune to fire, it gains vulnerability to fire damage until the end of the efreeti's next turn. On a successful save, the creature takes half as much damage and doesn't gain vulnerability to fire damage.  
>
>### Reactions
>***Fiery Shield.*** The efreeti adds 5 to its AC against one melee attack that would hit it. To do so, the efreeti must see the attacker and be wielding a melee weapon. If the attack misses as a result of this, the attacker takes 7 (2d6) fire damage.
