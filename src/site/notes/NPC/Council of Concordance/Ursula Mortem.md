>***Elder Graystaff Magic.*** The hag carries a graystaff, a length of gray wood that is a focus for her inner power. She can ride the staff as if it were a broom of flying. While holding the staff, she can cast additional spells with her Innate Spellcasting trait (these spells are marked with an asterisk). If the staff is lost or destroyed, the hag must craft another, which takes a year and a day. Only a bheur hag can use a graystaff.  
>
>***Ice Walk.*** The hag can move across and climb icy surfaces without needing to make an ability check. Additionally, difficult terrain composed of ice or snow doesn't cost her extra moment.  
>
>***Innate Spellcasting.*** The hag's innate spellcasting ability is Charisma (spell save DC 15, +7 to hit with spell attacks). She can innately cast the following spells, without providing material components:  
>
>At will: *armor of Agathys**, *hold person**, *ray of frost* (3d8 damage), *sleet storm**, *Snilloc's snowball swarm**  
>3/day each: *cone of cold**, *ice storm**, *investiture of ice**, *wall of ice**  
>1/day: *control weather*  
>
>### Actions
>***Multiattack.*** The hag makes two slam attacks.  
>
>***Slam.*** *Melee Weapon Attack:* +7 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. *Hit:* 12 (2d8 + 3) bludgeoning damage plus 7 (2d6) cold damage.  
>
>***Maddening Feast.*** The hag feasts on the corpse of one enemy within 5 feet of her that died within the past minute. Each creature of the hag's choice that is within 60 feet of her and able to see her must succeed on a DC 15 Wisdom saving throw or be frightened of her for 1 minute. While frightened in this way, a creature is incapacitated, can't understand what others say, can't read, and speaks only in gibberish; the DM controls the creature's movement, which is erratic. A creature can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success. If a creature's saving throw is successful or the effect ends for it, the creature is immune to the hag's Maddening Feast for the next 24 hours.  
>
>***Numbing Cackle (Recharge 5â€“6).*** The hag makes a chilling cackle. Each creature that isn't immune to cold within 30 feet of the hag and able to hear the hag must succeed on a DC 15 Constitution saving throw. On a failed save, a target becomes vulnerable to cold, its speed is halved, it can't take reactions, and it can take either an action or a bonus action on its turn, not both. The effects last for 1 minute. A creature can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success. On a successful save, a creature takes half as much damage and suffers no other effects.

# Bheur Hag
Bheur hags live in wintry lands, favoring snowy mountains. These hags become more active during winter, using their ice and weather magic to make life miserable for nearby settlements.

A bheur hag's skin has the bluish hue of a person who has frozen to death. The hag's hair is white, and the hag is emaciated, with pale eyes surrounded by bruise-colored flesh. A bheur hag carries a twisted gray wooden staff that can be ridden like a flying broom and that augments the hag's magic.

Bheur hags are attracted to selfish actions inspired by deadly cold, such as murdering a traveler for a winter coat or chopping down a dryad's grove for firewood. These actions are especially sweet to a bheur if they are unwarranted, such as a greedy merchant hoarding excess food for the winter while others starve. Bheurs use their ability to manipulate weather to batter villages with freezing cold, hoping to instill a despair that turns folk against each other.

In combat, a bheur hag also strives to inspire horror. When near a recently slain foe, the hag may forgo an attack to feed on the corpse. The sight of this butchery is enough to terrify most witnesses.
