## Autumn Eladrin, Elder
### Eladrin, Elder
Elder eladrin are powerful noble eladrin who rule over other eladrin in majestic [[Places/Cosmology/Planes of Existance/Reflection Planes/Feywild|Feywild]] cities filled with breathtaking elven architecture that are over a thousand years old. They strive to uphold the ideals of the [[Places/Cosmology/Planes of Existance/Reflection Planes/Feywild|Feywild]] in the hopes that after their death, they would reincarnate as Archfey or members of the Seelie or Unseelie Court.
