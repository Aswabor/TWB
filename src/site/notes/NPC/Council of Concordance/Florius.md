>***Elemental Demise.*** If the marid dies, its body disintegrates into crystalline powder, leaving behind only equipment the marid was wearing or carrying.  
>

>
>At will: *create food and water*, *detect evil and good*, *detect magic*, *fog cloud*, *purify food and drink*, *tongues*, *water breathing*, *water walk*

>### Actions
>***Multiattack.*** The marid makes two trident attacks.  
>
>***Trident.*** *Melee Weapon Attack:* +12 to hit, reach 10 ft. or range 20/60 ft., one target. *Hit:* 14 (2d6 + 7) piercing damage, or 16 (2d8 +7) piercing damage if used with two hands to make a melee attack.  
>
>***Water Jet.*** The marid magically shoots water in a 60-foot line that is 5 feet wide. Each creature in that line must make a DC 17 Dexterity saving throw. On a failure, a target takes 21 (6d6) bludgeoning damage and, if it is Huge or smaller, is pushed up to 20 feet away from the marid and knocked prone. On a success, a target takes half the bludgeoning damage, but is neither pushed nor knocked prone.  
>
>***Water Spouts (Recharge 5â€“6).*** The marid targets up to four creatures it can see within 30 feet of it and magically creates powerful water spouts beneath them. Each target must succeed on a DC 17 Dexterity saving throw. On a failed save, a creature takes 21 (6d6) bludgeoning damage, and if it is Large or smaller, is flung upward up to 30 feet. If a thrown target strikes an object, such as a wall or floor, the target takes 3 (1d6) bludgeoning damage for every 10 feet it was thrown. At the end of the turn, the water spouts end and the affected creatures fall back down (taking falling damage) and are knocked prone. On a successful save, the creature takes half as much damage and is not flung upward.
