>***Elemental Demise.*** If the djinni dies, its body disintegrates into crystalline powder, leaving behind only equipment the djinni was wearing or carrying.  
>
>***Innate Spellcasting.*** The djinni's innate spellcasting ability is Charisma (spell save DC 18). The djinni can innately cast the following spells, without providing material components:  
>
>At will: *create food and water* (can create wine instead of water), *detect evil and good*, *detect magic*, *thunderwave*, *tongues*, *wind walk*

>1/day: *chain lightning*  
>
>### Actions
>***Multiattack.*** The djinni makes three scimitar attacks. The djinni can replace one of those attacks with Spirit Away.  
>
>***Scimitar.*** *Melee Weapon Attack:* +11 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. *Hit:* 13 (2d6 + 6) slashing damage plus 3 (1d6) lightning or thunder damage (djinni's choice).  
>
>***Create Whirlwind.*** A 5-foot-radius, 30-foot-tall cylinder of swirling air magically forms on a point the djinni can see within 120 feet of it. The whirlwind lasts as long as the djinni maintains concentration (as if concentrating on a spell). Any creature but the djinni that enters the whirlwind must succeed on a DC 20 Strength saving throw or be restrained by it. The djinni can move the whirlwind up to 60 feet as an action, and creatures restrained by the whirlwind move with it. The whirlwind ends if the djinni loses sight of it.  
>A creature can use its action to free a creature restrained by the whirlwind, including itself, by succeeding on a DC 20 Strength check. If the check succeeds, the creature is no longer restrained and moves to the nearest space outside the whirlwind.  
>
>***Spirit Away.*** The djinni targets a nonhostile creature within 60 feet of it. Until the end of the turn, the target gains a flying speed of 40 feet and can use its reaction to move up to its flying speed without provoking opportunity attacks.  
>
>### Reactions
>***Intercept Attack.*** In response to another creature within 5 feet of it being hit by an attack roll, the djinni gives that creature a +5 bonus to its AC against that attack, potentially causing a miss. To use this ability, the djinni must be able to see the creature and the attacker.
