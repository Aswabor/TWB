# Ravnica
Ravnica is a worldwide cityscape; an [ecumenopolis](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ecumenopolis "wikipedia:Ecumenopolis") consisting of a patchwork of grand halls, decrepit slums, and ancient ruins, with layer upon layer of stonework. Law magic and the metaphysics of hierarchy are deeply woven into the very fabric of the plane, enabling cooperating leaders to achieve feats of greatness.

Of the world's countless civic centers, one looms large above all others: the City of Ravnica, a metropolis so vast that its name has long since become synonymous with the entire plane. Centuries of Ravnican business—powered in many cases by Izzet boilerworks and other guilds’ foundries—have saturated Ravnica's atmosphere with all manner of industrial pollution. Prior to the events of [_Dissension_](https://mtg.fandom.com/wiki/Dissension_(novel) "Dissension (novel)"), the city and plane of Ravnica had been ruled by the [Ravnican guilds](https://mtg.fandom.com/wiki/Ravnican_guild "Ravnican guild") and governed by the [Guildpact](https://mtg.fandom.com/wiki/Guildpact_(spell) "Guildpact (spell)") for more than ten millennia.

Ravnica has two moons. While much of its surface is urbanized, subterranean oceans exist.
