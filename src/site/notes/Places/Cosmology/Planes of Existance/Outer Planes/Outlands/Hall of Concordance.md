The Judges in attendance are all emissaries of the outer Planes or other powerful entities and call themselfs the [[NPC/Council of Concordance/Council of Concordance|Council of Concordance]]. It is an embassy of law, dedicated to the signing and enforcement of contracts.

The marut then becomes bound to ensure that the contract is fulfilled to the letter.
