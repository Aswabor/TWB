# Ash
[[Places/Cosmology/Planes of Existance/Inner Planes/Negative Quasi-Elemental Planes/Negative Quasi-Elemental Planes|Negative Quasi-Elemental Planes]]
### Ash: An Outsider’s Perspective
Transitioning from the Plane of [[Places/Cosmology/Planes of Existance/Inner Planes/Elemental Planes/Plane of Fire|Plane of Fire]] to the [[Places/Cosmology/Planes of Existance/Inner Planes/Energy Planes/Negative Energy Plane|Negative Energy Plane]], Ash is thought to be the cooling of the [[Places/Cosmology/Planes of Existance/Inner Planes/Elemental Planes/Plane of Fire|Plane of Fire]], as no warmth can be found here. Instead, only the remains of material long ago burned and destroyed by [[Places/Cosmology/Planes of Existance/Inner Planes/Elemental Planes/Plane of Fire|Plane of Fire]] remains. The entire plane is covered in ash that hangs in the area, restricting vision and creating a poisonous atmosphere for those who inhale in the ash. The ground is thick, made up of millions of thick fluffy flakes of ash that are compressed to create a springy ground that is easy to dig through.

### Ash: A Native’s Perspective
Cold. Grey. Miles upon unlimited miles of ash that chokes all who enter this realm. The inhabitants of this realm are just as cold as the plane they reside on, having little care for others to the point of wanting to convert them into ash themselves. The inhabitants of this plane are largely the quasielementals, beings of ash themselves. They see anyone visiting their plane as intruders, only fit to be killed and turned into the ash. The ash quasielementals have a single large empire focused around a fortification known as the Citadel of Former Flame where they plan their attacks on the Plane of [[Places/Cosmology/Planes of Existance/Inner Planes/Elemental Planes/Plane of Fire|Plane of Fire]]. They hope to one day destroy the plane since once the [[Places/Cosmology/Planes of Existance/Inner Planes/Elemental Planes/Plane of Fire|Plane of Fire]] dies out, all that remains is ash.
Rumors swirl that there is a substance on this plane known as mage powder and that it can drain the spells out of a spellcaster. This ash is highly prized and one of the few reasons outsiders intrude on the inhabitants, hoping to find some of this ash.

## Traits
### Ash: Atmosphere
This plane exists without light or heat with choking ash polluting what passes for an atmosphere. It isn’t uncommon to find frozen bodies covered in a layer of ash as any temperature above freezing is considered hot on this plane. Those who visit this plane can’t see further than 100 feet in the clearest sections of the plane and begin freezing immediately upon entering. Anyone who breathes the [[Places/Cosmology/Planes of Existance/Inner Planes/Elemental Planes/Plane of Air|Plane of Air]], without first casting a breathing spell, immediately begins suffocating on the ash.

### Ash: Traversing the Plane
Traveling across the plane can be easy, as if walking across a spongy ground of grey ash flakes, or very difficult, like digging your way through loose [[Places/Cosmology/Planes of Existance/Inner Planes/Elemental Planes/Plane of Earth|Plane of Earth]] that threatens to collapse constantly. In locations closer to the Plane of [[Places/Cosmology/Planes of Existance/Inner Planes/Elemental Planes/Plane of Fire|Plane of Fire]], the ash is far more compacted, similar to the super-compact [[Places/Cosmology/Planes of Existance/Inner Planes/Elemental Planes/Plane of Fire|Plane of Fire]] that makes up the ‘ground’ of [[Places/Cosmology/Planes of Existance/Inner Planes/Elemental Planes/Plane of Fire|Plane of Fire]]. As you travel closer to the [[Places/Cosmology/Planes of Existance/Inner Planes/Energy Planes/Negative Energy Plane|Negative Energy Plane]], ash becomes more sparse and you can eventually ‘fall’ the same way a traveler would do on the Plane of [[Places/Cosmology/Planes of Existance/Inner Planes/Elemental Planes/Plane of Air|Plane of Air]], adjusting their subjective gravity with their mind.

## Ash: Locations
![[image-asset-6.jpeg]]
Ash shares borders with the [[Places/Cosmology/Planes of Existance/Inner Planes/Energy Planes/Negative Energy Plane|Negative Energy Plane]], [[Places/Cosmology/Planes of Existance/Inner Planes/Negative Quasi-Elemental Planes/Plane of  Dust|Plane of  Dust]], [[Places/Cosmology/Planes of Existance/Inner Planes/Para Elemental Planes/Plane of Magma|Plane of Magma]], the Plane of Flame, [[Places/Cosmology/Planes of Existance/Inner Planes/Para Elemental Planes/Plane of Smoke|Plane of Smoke]], and [[Places/Cosmology/Planes of Existance/Inner Planes/Negative Quasi-Elemental Planes/Plane of  Vacuum|Plane of  Vacuum]], each creating a unique interaction with the choking ash. [[Places/Cosmology/Planes of Existance/Inner Planes/Negative Quasi-Elemental Planes/Plane of  Dust|Plane of  Dust]] and Ash blend together in an ambiguous realm known as the Wasting Place where the frigid cold of Ash and the gradual disintegration of [[Places/Cosmology/Planes of Existance/Inner Planes/Negative Quasi-Elemental Planes/Plane of  Dust|Plane of  Dust]] meet. This realm is mysterious, as little is known of this realm and few chose to visit it. [[Places/Cosmology/Planes of Existance/Inner Planes/Negative Quasi-Elemental Planes/Plane of  Vacuum|Plane of  Vacuum]] creates the Sparkling Vast, a realm undergoing the utter emptiness of a [[Places/Cosmology/Planes of Existance/Inner Planes/Negative Quasi-Elemental Planes/Plane of  Vacuum|Plane of  Vacuum]]. Before it fully takes form, the ash becomes a gritty residue like splintered glass, gleaming brilliantly when exposed to light. Those who journey through here are subjected to sheer cold that the longer they stay here, the harder it becomes to move until they freeze solid, even those beings of [[Places/Cosmology/Planes of Existance/Inner Planes/Para Elemental Planes/Plane of Ice|Plane of Ice]] have formed statues on this realm. 

The space near the Plane of [[Places/Cosmology/Planes of Existance/Inner Planes/Elemental Planes/Plane of Fire|Plane of Fire]] is called the Sea of Frozen Flames, this place of chilling cold gradually gives way to the all-consuming flames of [[Places/Cosmology/Planes of Existance/Inner Planes/Elemental Planes/Plane of Fire|Plane of Fire]]. The sea itself is a place that produces no heat but still burns away flesh as quickly as hot coals, the crystalline [[Places/Cosmology/Planes of Existance/Inner Planes/Elemental Planes/Plane of Fire|Plane of Fire]] purifying anything that enters it. As an opposite, where Ash adjoins the [[Places/Cosmology/Planes of Existance/Inner Planes/Energy Planes/Negative Energy Plane|Negative Energy Plane]], the realm is known as the Empty Winter of such cold that it drains a body’s heat, slowly freezing visitors as the diffused clouds of drifting flakes move across the plane.

[[Places/Cosmology/Planes of Existance/Inner Planes/Para Elemental Planes/Plane of Magma|Plane of Magma]] and Ash create the realm known as the Cinder Wells, marked by frigid patches of volcanic ash and rivers of glowing [[Places/Cosmology/Planes of Existance/Inner Planes/Para Elemental Planes/Plane of Magma|Plane of Magma]]. Where Ash reaches [[Places/Cosmology/Planes of Existance/Inner Planes/Para Elemental Planes/Plane of Smoke|Plane of Smoke]], it creates Embers, a vast cloud of hot, stinging heat that still has not yet been cooled by this plane. 

There are not many large sites on Ash, though dozens of tiny settlements dot the plane, it is difficult building structures out of the Ash.

### Cavitius
Floating out near, and sometimes in, the [[Places/Cosmology/Planes of Existance/Inner Planes/Energy Planes/Negative Energy Plane|Negative Energy Plane]], this structure resembles that of a gruesome skull. It’s an ancient structure, and no one is quite sure when it was built. Some believe that even the Doomguard, who once held the structure eons ago, weren’t the first residents, that they simply took it over from another group who had stolen the structure from another. The Doomguard can no longer be found here since they were kicked out by a powerful, old lich known as Vecna. Vecna stayed here for some time, but he soon left and now the building lies empty, but its time under Vecna has changed it permanently. Haunted souls, evil specters, and other supernatural creatures reside in these halls, hunting down any living creature that’d try to live here.

### The Citadel of Former Flame
Ruled over by Gazra, the Shifting Emperor of the ash quasielemental empire. This citadel was carved from solidified ash by the elementals. Gazra uses undead protectors, like ghouls, wraiths, ghosts, and more to protect himself and his citadel from prying eyes. Few know of Gazra, but those who do speak of a horrible ambition, he isn’t powerful enough to be an archomental, but he is working on it and working quickly.  

### The Crumbling Citadel
The Doomguard still want to have a holding on this plane, and so when their fortifications, Cavitius, was taken from them, they quickly began work on their next home. The Crumbling Citadel is their attempt to control the element of Ash, solidifying it into a structure, though it is constantly crumbling. Some believe the Doomguard actually like its deteriorating state, that it reflects the entropy in their hearts. 

Ever since the end of the Faction War, the Crumbling Citadel has seen an uptick in traffic. Over four hundred Doomguards reside here, as well as hundreds more in the other towers of these planes. They are hoping to consolidate their strength and eventually begin setting up another headquarters at a major city in the not so distant future.
