# What are the Negative Quasi-Elemental Planes?
Between the major Inner Planes are the negative quasi-elemental planes that bridge the gap between them and the [[Places/Cosmology/Planes of Existance/Inner Planes/Energy Planes/Negative Energy Plane|Negative Energy Plane]]. Four quasi-elemental planes blend the decaying energy of Negative with the elements, creating worlds of deteriorating elements that focus on the decay and dissolution of elements into nothing. The four planes are [[Places/Cosmology/Planes of Existance/Inner Planes/Negative Quasi-Elemental Planes/Plane of Ash|Plane of Ash]], [[Places/Cosmology/Planes of Existance/Inner Planes/Negative Quasi-Elemental Planes/Plane of  Dust|Plane of  Dust]], [[Places/Cosmology/Planes of Existance/Inner Planes/Negative Quasi-Elemental Planes/Plane of  Salt|Plane of  Salt]], and [[Places/Cosmology/Planes of Existance/Inner Planes/Negative Quasi-Elemental Planes/Plane of  Vacuum|Plane of  Vacuum]], each adjoins a different elemental plane of [[Places/Cosmology/Planes of Existance/Inner Planes/Elemental Planes/Plane of Air|Plane of Air]], [[Places/Cosmology/Planes of Existance/Inner Planes/Elemental Planes/Plane of Fire|Plane of Fire]], [[Places/Cosmology/Planes of Existance/Inner Planes/Elemental Planes/Plane of Earth|Plane of Earth]], and [[Places/Cosmology/Planes of Existance/Inner Planes/Elemental Planes/Plane of Water|Plane of Water]], respectively. 

These planes are where elements go to decay and disappear into their final death, while the inhabitants of these planes might see the beauty in this death, it is often outside the minds of living mortals. For many travelers, these planes are almost as dangerous as the [[Places/Cosmology/Planes of Existance/Inner Planes/Energy Planes/Negative Energy Plane|Negative Energy Plane]] and pose very real risks for those who visit them.

## History
Much like the positive quasi-elemental planes, their negative versions are first introduced in the _Manual of the Planes (1987)_ where their foundations are laid. It’s not until _The Inner Planes (1998)_ that additional detail is provided on the inhabitants, specifics to the planes, and locations to visit.

## An Outsider’s Perspective
Entropy and loss are the main forces of the [[Places/Cosmology/Planes of Existance/Inner Planes/Energy Planes/Negative Energy Plane|Negative Energy Plane]], and it's influence bleeds over into the neighboring planes. These quasi-elemental planes are deadly and dangerous, their natural element that unites them together attracts those who view death as just a barrier.

## A Native’s Perspective
The beings of this plane are living, though many of them are undead. Many of them are rare and rarely see the benefit of leaving their home planes, simply because they are unable to live in places full of so many elements or life. Very few powers make their home on these planes, but it is often visited by those who value the powers of undeath.

## Atmosphere
While the atmosphere on these planes takes some influence from the major elemental plane that they bleed off from, they introduce their risks that are fueled by the [[Places/Cosmology/Planes of Existance/Inner Planes/Energy Planes/Negative Energy Plane|Negative Energy Plane]]. Not every plane is breathable, the hazards of each plane are dangerous in their respects, and sometimes the danger of visiting such a plane outweighs the reward of visiting it. These planes can support some life, though it often feels anathema to their place in the multiverse.

# Traits
## Travel to the Plane
Traveling to these planes is not difficult, though the number of ways of arriving at these planes is much more limited than if you were trying to reach the major Inner Planes. Known portals connected these planes to [[Places/Cosmology/Planes of Existance/Outer Planes/Outlands/Sigil|Sigil]], the Outlands, and many other places across the multiverse, but often these portals are only known by a few or are difficult to locate due to their chaotic and ever-changing nature.

Guides from the major planes can be hired, though they often will only take you to the border to the quasi-elemental plane and further. Many elementals that act as guides will immediately begin dissolving into the new plane as the [[Places/Cosmology/Planes of Existance/Inner Planes/Energy Planes/Negative Energy Plane|Negative Energy Plane]]’s influence begins to dispersing the element that makes up the elemental. It’s quite deadly to bring elements from other planes onto another, meaning travelers and adventurers need to find a guide once they do cross over the planes. 

Those dedicated to the [[Places/Cosmology/Planes of Existance/Inner Planes/Energy Planes/Negative Energy Plane|Negative Energy Plane]] often have portals that they guard fanatically, with the Doomguard faction one of the only groups to have a portal to each of these planes. Their devotion to the entropic end of the multiverse, the slow decay of everything around them, has made it so that they have a vested interest in these planes and have fortresses on each one.

While vortices, quick and temporary portals that are often one way, still form at points of large gatherings of elements, these elements rarely exist in large enough quantities in a single spot for a vortex to link to another plane. A vortex to [[Places/Cosmology/Planes of Existance/Inner Planes/Negative Quasi-Elemental Planes/Plane of  Salt|Plane of  Salt]] may appear in salt flats, while [[Places/Cosmology/Planes of Existance/Inner Planes/Negative Quasi-Elemental Planes/Plane of  Dust|Plane of  Dust]] could form inside of the swirling sands of a desert, [[Places/Cosmology/Planes of Existance/Inner Planes/Negative Quasi-Elemental Planes/Plane of Ash|Plane of Ash]] could appear in a thoroughly burned down forest, while [[Places/Cosmology/Planes of Existance/Inner Planes/Negative Quasi-Elemental Planes/Plane of  Vacuum|Plane of  Vacuum]] requires very specific conditions of pure nothingness before it can form. Even the space outside of the known world is not devoid of enough matter to be pure enough for such a vortex.

## Traversing the Plane
Traversing these planes is difficult for those unprepared, and it isn’t solely because of the inhabitants or the elemental hazards of these planes. These planes are about the decay of all matter and energy, living creatures are anathema to the quasi-elemental plane’s major influence and so these planes are inherently dangerous.

# Locations
While there are not many reasons to visit each of these planes, there are still a few reasons and so some settlements have formed up. Since these planes link the major Inner Planes to the [[Places/Cosmology/Planes of Existance/Inner Planes/Energy Planes/Negative Energy Plane|Negative Energy Plane]], they are often seen as a bridge for those hoping to travel in that direction. 

Also, each plane has a tower controlled by the Doomguard, even after the Faction War, who value being so close to the entropic center of the multiverse, the [[Places/Cosmology/Planes of Existance/Inner Planes/Energy Planes/Negative Energy Plane|Negative Energy Plane]]. These towers and castles are made by the materials of each plane and the Doomguard expends a lot of energy in ensuring that they don’t crumble away like every other structure on these quasi-elemental planes. 

At the borderlines between the planes, it can be difficult to tell where one quasi-elemental plane ends and the other begins. These borders are split across the planes, each creating a realm influenced by their major element, the [[Places/Cosmology/Planes of Existance/Inner Planes/Energy Planes/Negative Energy Plane|Negative Energy Plane]], and each other, this is similar to the major Inner Planes and how at their borders they have created the para-elemental planes.

# Factions & People
## The Powers
Like a mirror to the Positive Quasi-Elemental Planes, only one power claims a domain on these planes, and that is Sun Sing. This mysterious entity lives at the heart of a negative energy pocket on [[Places/Cosmology/Planes of Existance/Inner Planes/Negative Quasi-Elemental Planes/Plane of  Vacuum|Plane of  Vacuum]], though no one knows how it survives such a place as not even the most powerful gods could accomplish that. No one knows what Sun Sing is, some believe it is the last void mephit, an ancient lich or demilich, or some other power of evil and destruction. Sun Sing even has agents and priests devoted to it, guiding them to bring entropy to the worlds. 

### Archomentals
While Gazra of [[Places/Cosmology/Planes of Existance/Inner Planes/Negative Quasi-Elemental Planes/Plane of Ash|Plane of Ash]] is not yet powerful enough to claim this title, it hasn’t stopped him from growing his forces and control over [[Places/Cosmology/Planes of Existance/Inner Planes/Negative Quasi-Elemental Planes/Plane of Ash|Plane of Ash]]. As far as anyone can tell, Gazra is hoping to first grow his power to that of a primordial and then begin an everlasting war against the Plane of [[Places/Cosmology/Planes of Existance/Inner Planes/Elemental Planes/Plane of Fire|Plane of Fire]], the hope of extinguishing it and gaining even more territory.

## Quasielmentals
These elementals are known as quasielementals by sages and researchers of the planes, though the elementals themselves don’t refer to themselves as such. They are thought to be the plane given sentience and are often summoned by the spellcasters looking to trap elemental energies or control elementals in battle. Most of these elementals that walk their plane are simply the animals of their planes, creating the birds, vermin, and natural beasts in varying displays of elements. From sand worms to [[Places/Cosmology/Planes of Existance/Inner Planes/Negative Quasi-Elemental Planes/Plane of  Dust|Plane of  Dust]] rats, and from [[Places/Cosmology/Planes of Existance/Inner Planes/Negative Quasi-Elemental Planes/Plane of  Salt|Plane of  Salt]] wolves to the invisible animals of [[Places/Cosmology/Planes of Existance/Inner Planes/Negative Quasi-Elemental Planes/Plane of  Vacuum|Plane of  Vacuum]], these creatures have a natural place in their ecosystems.

## Zal the Destroyer
One of the most powerful, known, entities of these planes, this beholder resides on [[Places/Cosmology/Planes of Existance/Inner Planes/Negative Quasi-Elemental Planes/Plane of  Vacuum|Plane of  Vacuum]] on a tumbling block of [[Places/Cosmology/Planes of Existance/Inner Planes/Para Elemental Planes/Plane of Ice|Plane of Ice]]. This massive beholder is easily double or triple the size of a normal beholder and has over three dozen beholders that follow his orders and carry out his tasks. In addition to the beholders, he also has an army of quasielementals that follow his commands, and allow him to continue his wanton violence and annihilation of every living creature they come across. No one knows what his ultimate goals are except the destruction of all. 

# Encounters
**Dust Quest** - Certain magical items, like _dust of sneezing and coughing_ as well as _dust of disappearance_ can be formed from the special [[Places/Cosmology/Planes of Existance/Inner Planes/Negative Quasi-Elemental Planes/Plane of  Dust|Plane of  Dust]] on its plane. Unfortunately, the inhabitants hate those who would mine out their precious dust and so guards must be called on to protect the miners who gather up these valuable resources.

**The Elemental War** - Much like how the Blood War is being waged across the Lower Planes between the devils and demons, a new war might start soon but will be against the elementals. Facets from [[Places/Cosmology/Planes of Existance/Inner Planes/Negative Quasi-Elemental Planes/Plane of  Salt|Plane of  Salt]] are planning to move against [[Places/Cosmology/Planes of Existance/Inner Planes/Elemental Planes/Plane of Water|Plane of Water]], and since they multiply when exposed to [[Places/Cosmology/Planes of Existance/Inner Planes/Elemental Planes/Plane of Water|Plane of Water]], it could be a very dangerous war that only ends once all of [[Places/Cosmology/Planes of Existance/Inner Planes/Elemental Planes/Plane of Water|Plane of Water]] has turned to brine. Gazra, of [[Places/Cosmology/Planes of Existance/Inner Planes/Negative Quasi-Elemental Planes/Plane of Ash|Plane of Ash]], is also focused on taking over more territory so that he might become an archomental, also known as a primordial. No one is quite sure of his plans, but undead and elemental forces are moving quickly to the borders of [[Places/Cosmology/Planes of Existance/Inner Planes/Elemental Planes/Plane of Fire|Plane of Fire]].

**Rusting Rumors** - Located in the Wasting Place, a Doomguard has claimed to have found a decaying city not yet destroyed. They claim of ancient constructs, of flying vehicles with wheels that do not roll against the ground. That, while the city appears abandoned, that entities still reside and that its original occupants never left.

**Vecna’s Lost Experiment** - On [[Places/Cosmology/Planes of Existance/Inner Planes/Negative Quasi-Elemental Planes/Plane of Ash|Plane of Ash]] is the old labs of Vecna in the fortress of Cavitius. Ancient power, lost relics, and more could be found in these haunted halls. 

**Zal’s Last Stand** - The beholder has had troubling visions from the Great Mother, the deity of the beholders, that the Doomguard are planning a large assault on his castle. Zal is confident that he will survive, but his dreams keep showing him somehow being defeated. While Zal has never backed down from a challenge, these uneasy dreams keep pointing him to a group of adventurers, maybe they are his saviors or his killers.
