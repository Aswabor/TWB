# Salt
[[Places/Cosmology/Planes of Existance/Inner Planes/Negative Quasi-Elemental Planes/Negative Quasi-Elemental Planes|Negative Quasi-Elemental Planes]]
### Salt: An Outsider’s Perspective
Bridging the gap between the Plane of [[Places/Cosmology/Planes of Existance/Inner Planes/Elemental Planes/Plane of Water|Plane of Water]] and the deterioration of the [[Places/Cosmology/Planes of Existance/Inner Planes/Energy Planes/Negative Energy Plane|Negative Energy Plane]] is salt. This plane is solely composed of great salt blocks and salt caverns that suck any moisture out of this plane. Even travelers are susceptible as they slowly become dehydrated on this plane, no matter how much [[Places/Cosmology/Planes of Existance/Inner Planes/Elemental Planes/Plane of Water|Plane of Water]] they bring with them. This plane is of an ever draining need, constantly looking to take and quench its never-ending thirst.

### Salt: A Native’s Perspective
This gasping, leeching plane can never be satisfied. The salt here drains the very atmosphere of moisture, causing outsiders to immediately feel a gnawing thirst that never goes away. Blood spilled is greedily consumed by the plane and once-living bodies soon wither away, becoming instantly mummified by this plane. The two dominant creatures of this plane are the salt quasielementals, though little is known of them, and the facets, though they stick along the border to the Plane of [[Places/Cosmology/Planes of Existance/Inner Planes/Elemental Planes/Plane of Water|Plane of Water]]. 

The elementals are similar to their plane, looking and searching for something to consume, to fill their salt bodies with something. While they can be negotiated with, it must be done quickly and offer something, like a large quantity of [[Places/Cosmology/Planes of Existance/Inner Planes/Elemental Planes/Plane of Water|Plane of Water]], to slake their thirst. They can never be satisfied though, and so gifts and materials must be constantly supplied to them. The other group, the facets, reside in the caustic brine waters as they begin their plans. They are hoping to attack the Plane of [[Places/Cosmology/Planes of Existance/Inner Planes/Elemental Planes/Plane of Water|Plane of Water]], thus growing their empire across the planes.

## Traits
### Salt: Atmosphere
Unlike the other negative quasi-elemental planes, Salt does have a breathable atmosphere, though all that does is help dry out your lungs and make visitors thirsty. Salt tinges everything on this plane and there is no way to satisfy it. All visitors can do is go about their tasks quickly as their constitution is slowly drained out of them as they search for anything to quench this never-ending thirst. Those who are unable to escape this plane eventually have all moisture leached out of their skin and they begin growing salt crystals across their body until they die, gaining the appearance of mummification.

### Salt: Traversing the Plane
Much like the Plane of [[Places/Cosmology/Planes of Existance/Inner Planes/Elemental Planes/Plane of Earth|Plane of Earth]], if adventurers wish to travel anywhere, they must dig through the soft salt that makes up this plane. The elementals of this plane can help expedite this process, as they know where there are safe places for adventurers on this plane, though they charge a high amount and must be constantly pacified. The closer travelers get to the [[Places/Cosmology/Planes of Existance/Inner Planes/Energy Planes/Negative Energy Plane|Negative Energy Plane]], the less salt they must dig through until it is so loose that they can simply fall in a direction of their choice, like on the Plane of [[Places/Cosmology/Planes of Existance/Inner Planes/Elemental Planes/Plane of Air|Plane of Air]].

## Salt: Locations
![[image-asset-7.jpeg]]
Salt shares borders with the [[Places/Cosmology/Planes of Existance/Inner Planes/Energy Planes/Negative Energy Plane|Negative Energy Plane]], [[Places/Cosmology/Planes of Existance/Inner Planes/Negative Quasi-Elemental Planes/Plane of  Vacuum|Plane of  Vacuum]], [[Places/Cosmology/Planes of Existance/Inner Planes/Para Elemental Planes/Plane of Ice|Plane of Ice]], the Plane of [[Places/Cosmology/Planes of Existance/Inner Planes/Elemental Planes/Plane of Water|Plane of Water]], [[Places/Cosmology/Planes of Existance/Inner Planes/Para Elemental Planes/Plane of Ooze|Plane of Ooze]], and [[Places/Cosmology/Planes of Existance/Inner Planes/Negative Quasi-Elemental Planes/Plane of  Dust|Plane of  Dust]], each creating a unique interaction with the draining salt. Salt and [[Places/Cosmology/Planes of Existance/Inner Planes/Negative Quasi-Elemental Planes/Plane of  Vacuum|Plane of  Vacuum]] create the Flats, a vast plain of hard-packed salt. This plain is a dangerous realm of greed, constantly draining travelers of life and breath. Quasielementals find this location to be quite hospitable as they can ignore its effects. [[Places/Cosmology/Planes of Existance/Inner Planes/Negative Quasi-Elemental Planes/Plane of  Dust|Plane of  Dust]] creates the realm of Consumption, a realm of sandstorms of [[Places/Cosmology/Planes of Existance/Inner Planes/Negative Quasi-Elemental Planes/Plane of  Dust|Plane of  Dust]] and salt, breaking explorers apart while leeching away their moisture. Of all the places in Salt, this is the least inhabited

The space near the Plane of [[Places/Cosmology/Planes of Existance/Inner Planes/Elemental Planes/Plane of Water|Plane of Water]] is known as the Saline Sea, a vast ocean of brine waters. These waves are so salty that no living creature can reside within, that even touching this toxic [[Places/Cosmology/Planes of Existance/Inner Planes/Elemental Planes/Plane of Water|Plane of Water]] is enough to cause deadly blood poisoning, causing outsiders to collapse as the moisture in them escapes. As an opposite, where Salt adjoins the [[Places/Cosmology/Planes of Existance/Inner Planes/Energy Planes/Negative Energy Plane|Negative Energy Plane]], the realm is known as the Crystal Range. Barren mountains have formed in this realm, reaching to the black sky high above them. Dotted across these mountains are the salt statues of visitors as the negative energy accelerates the leeching property of Salt. 

[[Places/Cosmology/Planes of Existance/Inner Planes/Para Elemental Planes/Plane of Ice|Plane of Ice]] and Salt create the blizzard of Stinging Storms, where frozen pellets strike flesh, forming welts and horrible white scars as the skin is leeched of any moisture. Where Salt reaches [[Places/Cosmology/Planes of Existance/Inner Planes/Para Elemental Planes/Plane of Ooze|Plane of Ooze]], it creates the Stagnant Sea of caustic sludge that can eat through metal in minutes. 

Few structures reside on this plane, simply because the inhabitants don’t value such permanent settlements. Those who have made settlements must carve it from the salt around them, though much of it is quite soft and is prone to collapsing.

### Citadel Sealt

Carved out of the barren salt mountains that reside in the Crystal Range, no one is sure if the Doomguard were the ones to accomplish such a masterpiece, and even they have forgotten if they found this structure or built it. To outsiders, they’ll confidently claim they did it, but this structure is such an architectural mystery, carved from salt with no other component to help support it, that it must have taken the most skilled artisans in all the planes to accomplish such a feat. Many of the Doomguard who reside here now after the Faction War are the ones who would like to see the entropic death of the universe happen much quicker, and are finding ways to go about that.
