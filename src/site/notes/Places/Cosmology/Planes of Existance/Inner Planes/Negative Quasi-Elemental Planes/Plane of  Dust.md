# Dust
[[Places/Cosmology/Planes of Existance/Inner Planes/Negative Quasi-Elemental Planes/Negative Quasi-Elemental Planes|Negative Quasi-Elemental Planes]]
### Dust: An Outsider’s Perspective
As the Plane of [[Places/Cosmology/Planes of Existance/Inner Planes/Elemental Planes/Plane of Earth|Plane of Earth]] extends towards the [[Places/Cosmology/Planes of Existance/Inner Planes/Energy Planes/Negative Energy Plane|Negative Energy Plane]], it begins crumbling, losing the cohesion of [[Places/Cosmology/Planes of Existance/Inner Planes/Elemental Planes/Plane of Earth|Plane of Earth]] until it drifts like fine dust through the [[Places/Cosmology/Planes of Existance/Inner Planes/Elemental Planes/Plane of Air|Plane of Air]]. Eventually, these minute particles begin separating further apart as one travels closer to the [[Places/Cosmology/Planes of Existance/Inner Planes/Energy Planes/Negative Energy Plane|Negative Energy Plane]] until it is simply an expanse of black. All material breaks down on this plane, given enough time and proximity to the ultimate plane of deterioration.

### Dust: A Native’s Perspective
This plane is actually home to a large variety of creatures who have merged at least a portion of their essence into the plane. From the dust wolves who prowl this layer in vicious packs, to the sandsnakes, dao, xorn, silt weirds, dust mephits, and the dust quasielementals, this plane has more life in it than many of the other quasi-elemental planes. Of all the creatures on this plane, it is the dust quasielementals that make this plane more dangerous than the hazards. The dust elementals seek something, anything, to destroy and kill. Their relationship to the devastation of this plane is complete and they are difficult, if not impossible, to negotiate with. 

For this reason, almost every other creature who calls this plane home either attack these elements on sight or flee. Sandlings, dune stalkers, sandmen, and others have created large settlements and fortifications to act as some defense against these savage elementals, and some can live here in relative peace.

## Traits
### Dust: Atmosphere
Much like [[Places/Cosmology/Planes of Existance/Inner Planes/Negative Quasi-Elemental Planes/Plane of Ash|Plane of Ash]], this plane has no breathable atmosphere unless you can use magic to fix the [[Places/Cosmology/Planes of Existance/Inner Planes/Elemental Planes/Plane of Air|Plane of Air]] around you. Once you are no longer suffocating, you must then worry about the cohesiveness of your own body. Much like the plane, and how the closer it gets to the [[Places/Cosmology/Planes of Existance/Inner Planes/Energy Planes/Negative Energy Plane|Negative Energy Plane]], the more matter begins breaking apart, the same goes for visitors. Even magical items can begin deteriorating on this plane, the matter that makes up the item slowly begins separating further apart every hour they are on this plane. Those who spend too long here eventually disperse and their remains scattered across the plane. One of the few ways of surviving this transition is to transform your physical body into a gaseous form using spells and magic.

### Dust: Traversing the Plane
No gravity exists on the Plane of Dust, making it so that the only way to move is by having some magical ability to propel yourself forward or push yourself off some large dust mote. Creatures with wings have little to nothing to push to fly around, and so ill-prepared adventurers may simply hang in the atmosphere, unable to continue their journey as they slowly fade into dust. Those who are closer to the Plane of [[Places/Cosmology/Planes of Existance/Inner Planes/Elemental Planes/Plane of Earth|Plane of Earth]] experience some gravity, and it gets stronger the closer they get to the border.

## Dust: Locations
![[BordersDust_IP_2e.webp]]
Dust shares borders with the [[Places/Cosmology/Planes of Existance/Inner Planes/Energy Planes/Negative Energy Plane|Negative Energy Plane]], [[Places/Cosmology/Planes of Existance/Inner Planes/Negative Quasi-Elemental Planes/Plane of  Salt|Plane of  Salt]], [[Places/Cosmology/Planes of Existance/Inner Planes/Para Elemental Planes/Plane of Ooze|Plane of Ooze]], the Plane of [[Places/Cosmology/Planes of Existance/Inner Planes/Elemental Planes/Plane of Earth|Plane of Earth]], [[Places/Cosmology/Planes of Existance/Inner Planes/Para Elemental Planes/Plane of Magma|Plane of Magma]], and [[Places/Cosmology/Planes of Existance/Inner Planes/Negative Quasi-Elemental Planes/Plane of Ash|Plane of Ash]], each creating a unique interaction with the obliterating dust. Dust and [[Places/Cosmology/Planes of Existance/Inner Planes/Negative Quasi-Elemental Planes/Plane of Ash|Plane of Ash]] blend indistinctly into the Wasting Place that forms a choking cloud that tears apart visitors by the natural abrasion of dust while frozen in place by the warmth-hungry [[Places/Cosmology/Planes of Existance/Inner Planes/Negative Quasi-Elemental Planes/Plane of Ash|Plane of Ash]]. [[Places/Cosmology/Planes of Existance/Inner Planes/Negative Quasi-Elemental Planes/Plane of  Salt|Plane of  Salt]] creates the realm of Consumption, where any fluid is transformed into granules as it dries out and goes to the ever-thirst of [[Places/Cosmology/Planes of Existance/Inner Planes/Negative Quasi-Elemental Planes/Plane of  Salt|Plane of  Salt]]. Living creatures are quickly drained of moisture, their dried husks litter this realm.

The space near the Plane of [[Places/Cosmology/Planes of Existance/Inner Planes/Elemental Planes/Plane of Earth|Plane of Earth]] is known as the Tumbling Rocks where masses of stone crash and tumble into each other, slowly wearing each other down into tiny fragments that fill the plane with their dust. As an opposite, where Dust adjoins the [[Places/Cosmology/Planes of Existance/Inner Planes/Energy Planes/Negative Energy Plane|Negative Energy Plane]], the realm is known as the Storm of Annihilation. This dangerous and deadly realm whips up winds of elemental force that causes matter to decay and fall apart in an explosion. The battering winds kill in just moments, making it almost impossible for outsiders, and even inhabitants, to explore this area.

[[Places/Cosmology/Planes of Existance/Inner Planes/Para Elemental Planes/Plane of Magma|Plane of Magma]] and Dust create the realm of Sands, where flows of thick dust is interlaced with rivers of glowing [[Places/Cosmology/Planes of Existance/Inner Planes/Para Elemental Planes/Plane of Magma|Plane of Magma]]. Where Dust reaches [[Places/Cosmology/Planes of Existance/Inner Planes/Para Elemental Planes/Plane of Ooze|Plane of Ooze]], it creates the Oasis of Filth, a bog of disgusting slime that is half-congealed and thick with disease that even those who are immune to normal diseases can not resist. 

There are rarely any permanent sites on Dust as the destructive swirling of this plane quickly destroys anything unless it is protected from decay and entropy.

### Citadel Alluvius
One of the only permanent locations on this plane, the Citadel stands on a rotating disc of elemental [[Places/Cosmology/Planes of Existance/Inner Planes/Elemental Planes/Plane of Earth|Plane of Earth]] that is shielded from the consuming nature of this plane by a very powerful _wall of force_ spell. This citadel has the bulk of the Doomguard forces as well as the Doomlord, Pereid, who maintains the Doomguard faction despite the events of the Blood War. Of any place on this plane, the Doomguard are happy to welcome visitors of any kind, for this is their holy site and they believe all should be exposed to the entropy.
