# Ice
### Ice: An Outsider’s Perspective
Between the Plane of [[Places/Cosmology/Planes of Existance/Inner Planes/Elemental Planes/Plane of Air|Plane of Air]] and the Plane of [[Places/Cosmology/Planes of Existance/Inner Planes/Elemental Planes/Plane of Water|Plane of Water]], the Plane of Ice is a realm of freezing temperatures where everything freezes eventually. [[Places/Cosmology/Planes of Existance/Inner Planes/Elemental Planes/Plane of Water|Plane of Water]], flesh, blood, stone, metal, ice, and even words and thoughts freeze in this plane the closer one travels to the center of it. The entire plane is covered in freezing ice, creating twisting caverns and tunnels, with large chasms that shrink and grow as the ice moves and grows throughout the plane. Those who visit this plane do so to find frozen thoughts in the center of the plane, or to hunt the monsters who roam this plane, like yetis, animentals, ice mephits, and more.

### Ice: A Native’s Perspective
Freezing cold. Freezing chill. Miles upon miles of frozen caverns slowly freezing over and then re-freezing again. The inhabitants are cold just like their plane, uncaring for others who hate the cold and ice, looking with cool gazes at those who try to survive in this freezing realm. The inhabitants of this plane are largely the paraelementals who are ruled over by an up and coming archomental known as Cryonax. Cryonax rules from his icy fortress known as the Chiseled Estate and is focused on expanding his empire of ice and has imprisoned hundreds of wizards, some are even [[Places/Cosmology/Planes of Existance/Inner Planes/Elemental Planes/Plane of Water|Plane of Water]] and ice genasi, to help bolster his strengths and see him to victory.

## Traits
### Ice: Atmosphere
With its freezing [[Places/Cosmology/Planes of Existance/Inner Planes/Elemental Planes/Plane of Air|Plane of Air]], the Plane of Ice is aptly named. This plane exists without light except what outsiders and inhabitants create for themselves, and no heat can be squeezed out of this plane. Freezing bodies might form the largest population on this plane, though if rumors are to be believed, those individuals are still alive, you just have to unthaw them. Similar to the Plane of [[Places/Cosmology/Planes of Existance/Inner Planes/Elemental Planes/Plane of Earth|Plane of Earth]], Ice is made up of a massive glacier of ice that has tunnels crisscrossing throughout it. There is breathable [[Places/Cosmology/Planes of Existance/Inner Planes/Elemental Planes/Plane of Air|Plane of Air]] throughout the plane, though if travelers end up inside of the ice sheets, or the ice forms up around them, they’ll quickly be cut off and begin suffocation.

### Ice: Traversing the Plane
Depending on where a traveler is on the plane, they may have it quite easy or very difficult. In the areas near the Plane of [[Places/Cosmology/Planes of Existance/Inner Planes/Elemental Planes/Plane of Air|Plane of Air]], in a region known as Precipice, it is a sheer cliff that must be traversed up to get closer to the center of the plane. Spiked shoes, rope, pickaxes, and more are required to scale these cliffs, or one risks slipping on a slick piece of ice and plummeting to their freezing death hundreds of miles below them. As they journey towards the center of the plane, they must have access to some way to nullify the cold, though even that isn’t enough. Creatures immune to the cold, like white dragons and even creatures of ice, find the cold so painful that even they begin taking freezing. It isn’t unheard of to come across the frozen body of a creature in the twisting caverns of Ice.

As a traveler moves closer to the Plane of [[Places/Cosmology/Planes of Existance/Inner Planes/Elemental Planes/Plane of Water|Plane of Water]], the massive block of ice that forms most of this plane soon gives way to a freezing cold ocean. Icebergs float across the dark oceans, and some swear that the [[Places/Cosmology/Planes of Existance/Inner Planes/Elemental Planes/Plane of Water|Plane of Water]] itself is far colder than even the ice of this plane.

## Ice: Locations
![[image-asset-4.jpeg|image-asset-4.jpeg]]
Ice shares borders with the Plane of [[Places/Cosmology/Planes of Existance/Inner Planes/Elemental Planes/Plane of Air|Plane of Air]], [[Places/Cosmology/Planes of Existance/Inner Planes/Positive Quasi-Elemental Planes/Plane of Lightning|Plane of Lightning]], [[Places/Cosmology/Planes of Existance/Inner Planes/Positive Quasi-Elemental Planes/Plane of Steam|Plane of Steam]], the Plane of [[Places/Cosmology/Planes of Existance/Inner Planes/Elemental Planes/Plane of Water|Plane of Water]], [[Places/Cosmology/Planes of Existance/Inner Planes/Negative Quasi-Elemental Planes/Plane of  Salt|Plane of  Salt]], and [[Places/Cosmology/Planes of Existance/Inner Planes/Negative Quasi-Elemental Planes/Plane of  Vacuum|Plane of  Vacuum]], each creating a unique interaction with the blistering cold of ice. [[Places/Cosmology/Planes of Existance/Inner Planes/Positive Quasi-Elemental Planes/Plane of Lightning|Plane of Lightning]] and Ice creates a field of soft snow, blowing pleasantly across the landscape in a realm known as the Shimmering Drifts. While it may seem pleasant at first, if these electrical-charged snowflakes touch a creature, it can cause the creature to lose their wits and act as if they are under the effects of a _confusion_ spell. [[Places/Cosmology/Planes of Existance/Inner Planes/Positive Quasi-Elemental Planes/Plane of Steam|Plane of Steam]] and Ice create the realm of the Fog of Unyielding Frost, a place of super-cold vapors that if breathed can freeze your lungs solid. While it is survivable in this realm, those who reside or travel through here must always have some sort of protection from the cold.

Traveling towards the Plane of [[Places/Cosmology/Planes of Existance/Inner Planes/Elemental Planes/Plane of Air|Plane of Air]] is the region known as Precipice, this is at the very ‘top’ of Ice where snow-capped mountains and sheer ice cliffs creak and groan as the ice continues to grow. No sun illuminates this realm, making it so that to climb atop these cliffs or mountains, one must travel in the pitch-black of night. Moving downward, through the frozen ground towards the Plane of [[Places/Cosmology/Planes of Existance/Inner Planes/Elemental Planes/Plane of Water|Plane of Water]], it eventually turns into the frigid place known as the Sea of Frozen Lives, a surfaceless ocean of suspended icebergs. It is said that even the [[Places/Cosmology/Planes of Existance/Inner Planes/Elemental Planes/Plane of Water|Plane of Water]] is colder than the ice that holds it and that the icebergs that float in this liquid were once travelers who succumb to the cold.

[[Places/Cosmology/Planes of Existance/Inner Planes/Negative Quasi-Elemental Planes/Plane of  Salt|Plane of  Salt]] and Ice form a realm known as the Stinging Storm, a raging tempest of [[Places/Cosmology/Planes of Existance/Inner Planes/Negative Quasi-Elemental Planes/Plane of  Salt|Plane of  Salt]]-[[Places/Cosmology/Planes of Existance/Inner Planes/Elemental Planes/Plane of Water|Plane of Water]] and acrid crystals that hail across the realm. Those who get caught in a storm are forced to contend with crystals of all sizes hailing down in a devastating bludgeoning cacophony of pain and acidic burns. Where Ice reaches [[Places/Cosmology/Planes of Existance/Inner Planes/Negative Quasi-Elemental Planes/Plane of  Vacuum|Plane of  Vacuum]], it creates the Frigid Void, a realm free of ice and snow but it still retains its painful cold as well as the deadly void of nothing.

 There are only a few sites on Ice, for if you stop moving on this plane, you are likely to join the frozen statues of this realm. Traveling through the ice channels, even the warmth of a [[Places/Cosmology/Planes of Existance/Inner Planes/Elemental Planes/Plane of Fire|Plane of Fire]] is a danger as it can melt some of the ice around you, turning it into a chilling liquid that splashes down on you and then instantly refreezes with you in the center of this ice block. It is best to travel with a magically-created _light_ spell and protect oneself from the cold using magic.

### Arcolantha
Thought to be the place that every visitor should see, at a spot deep in the ice is a strange world that is unaffected by the growing realm of ice. It appears like a massive sphere with its ice-walls perfectly polished to a high sheen, making it easy to peer through the ice for hundreds of feet. There is even a large light in the center of this sphere that illuminates the entire structure in a brilliant light, but the beauty of ice isn’t the reason to visit this place. That reason is the thousands upon thousands of creatures that are ‘buried’ in the ice, these creatures, and even humanoids, have been taken from all across the multiverse and stored in the solid ice here. It's rumored if they were taken from this ice, they could be revived.

No one knows who is doing this, or for what reason, but travelers from all over who study specific creatures often venture here for a chance to look at one of their specimens up close through the ice.   

### The Chiseled Estate
Located on Precipice is the icy fortress of Cryonax, a colossal structure that extends well over a mile above the surface of the ice, as well as stretches far below in a vast underground network. In the very center lies a throne room where Cryonax rules from, watching over his realm and forming his plans on extending his power over ice and pushing the Plane of Ice and its freezing reach onto other planes. Found throughout his twisting fortress are yetis, frost-covered umber hulks, snowy ropers made of ice, and massive dire-beasts formed of ice and snow who safeguard his fortress from intruders.
