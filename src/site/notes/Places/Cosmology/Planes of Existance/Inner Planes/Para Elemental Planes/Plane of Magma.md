# Magma
### Magma: An Outsider’s Perspective
Between the Plane of [[Places/Cosmology/Planes of Existance/Inner Planes/Elemental Planes/Plane of Earth|Plane of Earth]] and the Plane of [[Places/Cosmology/Planes of Existance/Inner Planes/Elemental Planes/Plane of Fire|Plane of Fire]], the Plane of Magma is a flowing realm of super-heated rock. Large islands of obsidian float across the magma floes, with subterranean lava tubes that run throughout the plane like a spider web that is heavily used by traders and travelers as it is protected from the burning magma. Visitors are often searching across the plane for gems that form from the intense pressure and heat of this plane, as well as powerful wizards who have formed towers to study the elemental power of magma.

### Magma: A Native’s Perspective
Bubbling molten rock forms vast oceans of churning magma that threatens to burn everything that touches it. Those who live here must struggle against the burning rocks and caustic [[Places/Cosmology/Planes of Existance/Inner Planes/Elemental Planes/Plane of Air|Plane of Air]] of toxic fumes. While there are few settlements on this plane, at least visitable by outsiders, many of them are ruled over by individuals who are researching or hiding in, the Plane of Magma. The true rulers of this plane, the mephits, are vicious and cruel, they enjoy dominating any creature who comes to this plane, and by sheer numbers alone, can overtake any others on this plane. They are ruled over by a powerful magma mephit known as Chilimba, who insists that others call him the Searing Emperor, the First General of the Cauldron, and the Master of All Mephits. The mephits rarely negotiate and are seen as pests by outsiders like the efreet and dao who often meet on this plane.

## Traits
### Magma: Atmosphere
Magma has a definite gravity, and thus has a surface to it that most are forced to wade through or sail on an obsidian vessel. The [[Places/Cosmology/Planes of Existance/Inner Planes/Elemental Planes/Plane of Air|Plane of Air]] is sometimes breathable, though it is laced with the burning [[Places/Cosmology/Planes of Existance/Inner Planes/Para Elemental Planes/Plane of Smoke|Plane of Smoke]] of fires and magma. To survive these toxic fumes, the [[Places/Cosmology/Planes of Existance/Inner Planes/Elemental Planes/Plane of Air|Plane of Air]] must be filtered or magically treated to make it safe to breathe for those who require it. Trying to peer through this burning haze is largely restricted by the ever-present [[Places/Cosmology/Planes of Existance/Inner Planes/Para Elemental Planes/Plane of Smoke|Plane of Smoke]] and foul gases, making it difficult to make out any details from further away than 100 feet.

### Magma: Traversing the Plane
Luckily for travelers, gravity exists on this plane and makes getting around it somewhat simple. Those who can fly can easily soar above the burning magma, though they still must deal with the toxic fumes that rise to meet them. Those who lack such an ability have a few other options. They can try and trudge through the magma, half walking and half swimming through the burning magma. This is a slow and painful process as the sticky [[Places/Cosmology/Planes of Existance/Inner Planes/Elemental Planes/Plane of Fire|Plane of Fire]] burns anything within it that isn’t protected. 

Another option is to hire a dao obsidian ship that can sail across the churning sludge of Magma. These ships aren’t cheap but have natural bubbles of breathable [[Places/Cosmology/Planes of Existance/Inner Planes/Elemental Planes/Plane of Air|Plane of Air]] that are maintained around it with magic, making it the safest and easiest ride across the plane. It’s not cheap though, and the dao aren’t to be trusted as they have been known to make slaves of those who would hire their ships. Beyond simply swimming through the magma, there is also a complex lava tube network that spans the entire plane. In these hollow tubes, a traveler is protected from the sizzling magma, though the tubes do nothing to cleanse the [[Places/Cosmology/Planes of Existance/Inner Planes/Elemental Planes/Plane of Air|Plane of Air]]. Large trading caravans and explorers rely on these tubes to safely travel from the Plane of [[Places/Cosmology/Planes of Existance/Inner Planes/Elemental Planes/Plane of Earth|Plane of Earth]] to the Plane of [[Places/Cosmology/Planes of Existance/Inner Planes/Elemental Planes/Plane of Fire|Plane of Fire]].

## Magma: Locations
![[image-asset-3.jpeg]]
Magma shares borders with the Plane of [[Places/Cosmology/Planes of Existance/Inner Planes/Elemental Planes/Plane of Fire|Plane of Fire]], [[Places/Cosmology/Planes of Existance/Inner Planes/Negative Quasi-Elemental Planes/Plane of Ash|Plane of Ash]], [[Places/Cosmology/Planes of Existance/Inner Planes/Negative Quasi-Elemental Planes/Plane of  Dust|Plane of  Dust]], the Plane of [[Places/Cosmology/Planes of Existance/Inner Planes/Elemental Planes/Plane of Earth|Plane of Earth]], [[Places/Cosmology/Planes of Existance/Inner Planes/Positive Quasi-Elemental Planes/Plane of Mineral|Plane of Mineral]], and [[Places/Cosmology/Planes of Existance/Inner Planes/Positive Quasi-Elemental Planes/Plane of Radiance|Plane of Radiance]], each creating a unique interaction with the bubbling and churning mass of molten rock. [[Places/Cosmology/Planes of Existance/Inner Planes/Positive Quasi-Elemental Planes/Plane of Radiance|Plane of Radiance]] and Magma create the realm known as the Glowing Dunes, often thought to be one of the deadliest places in all the Inner Planes. Rolling hills are made of volcanic [[Places/Cosmology/Planes of Existance/Inner Planes/Negative Quasi-Elemental Planes/Plane of Ash|Plane of Ash]], and as one travels closer to [[Places/Cosmology/Planes of Existance/Inner Planes/Positive Quasi-Elemental Planes/Plane of Radiance|Plane of Radiance]] the [[Places/Cosmology/Planes of Existance/Inner Planes/Negative Quasi-Elemental Planes/Plane of  Dust|Plane of  Dust]] becomes metallic and radiates out energy and light. Those who travel across the hills risk catching a horrible disease or curse, no one truly knows what exactly it is but even those who are immune to such things can catch it. This disease or curse causes blistering skin, blindness, baldness, and hundreds of other symptoms before the eventual death. On the border of [[Places/Cosmology/Planes of Existance/Inner Planes/Positive Quasi-Elemental Planes/Plane of Mineral|Plane of Mineral]] and Magma is the realm of the Obsidian Forest, with massive spires of volcanic glass and crystals that rise out of the burning wasteland. Its thought that evil creatures of stone reside here, having fleed from a powerful archomental known as Ogremoch located on the Plane of [[Places/Cosmology/Planes of Existance/Inner Planes/Elemental Planes/Plane of Earth|Plane of Earth]].

Traveling towards the Plane of [[Places/Cosmology/Planes of Existance/Inner Planes/Elemental Planes/Plane of Earth|Plane of Earth]], the magma thickens and creates an area of basalt cliffs and spires that overlook rivers and lakes of lava known as the Scorched Wastes, this area is largely devoid of life except for firenewts and salamanders. In the opposite direction, heading towards the Plane of [[Places/Cosmology/Planes of Existance/Inner Planes/Elemental Planes/Plane of Fire|Plane of Fire]] is a realm known as the Searing Mists where fires erupt in massive explosions across the almost liquid-like magma that flows quickly across the surface like a massive churning ocean. At the very edge of the border against the Plane of [[Places/Cosmology/Planes of Existance/Inner Planes/Elemental Planes/Plane of Fire|Plane of Fire]] is a curtain of searing droplets of molten stone that form a fog-like haze separating the two planes.

Traveling towards the [[Places/Cosmology/Planes of Existance/Inner Planes/Energy Planes/Negative Energy Plane|Negative Energy Plane]] presents the two options of [[Places/Cosmology/Planes of Existance/Inner Planes/Negative Quasi-Elemental Planes/Plane of Ash|Plane of Ash]] and [[Places/Cosmology/Planes of Existance/Inner Planes/Negative Quasi-Elemental Planes/Plane of  Dust|Plane of  Dust]]. Where [[Places/Cosmology/Planes of Existance/Inner Planes/Negative Quasi-Elemental Planes/Plane of Ash|Plane of Ash]] and Magma meet is the region known as the Chalk Islands where islands of chalk rise up surrounded by rivers and oceans of magma. The islands are freezing cold and filled with the choking [[Places/Cosmology/Planes of Existance/Inner Planes/Negative Quasi-Elemental Planes/Plane of Ash|Plane of Ash]] of their plane, while the magma creates rivers of boiling heat, making it quite difficult for travelers to contend with such extremes. [[Places/Cosmology/Planes of Existance/Inner Planes/Negative Quasi-Elemental Planes/Plane of  Dust|Plane of  Dust]] and Magma form the Sands, a realm of desert-like qualities, though it is the coolest place on Magma. Moving through the sands, the particles slowly become more and more powder-like, wreaking havoc on metal and mechanical items that begin rusting and corroding from the [[Places/Cosmology/Planes of Existance/Inner Planes/Negative Quasi-Elemental Planes/Plane of  Dust|Plane of  Dust]]’s influence.

Few settlements have formed up on Magma, as it is quite a dangerous place to spend too much time thanks to the sudden jets of flame that explode across the surface. A few cities are known to exist on the surface of this realm, as well as more than a few laboratories and magical towers manned by sages and wizards who wish to be left alone so they might work on their magic in peace. 

### Fields of Nevermore
On the surface of this plane is a cool crust of stone that has grown thick enough to be used as the foundation of a city. While typically such stone would melt into the magma, there is a great and powerful artifact at the center of this city known as the _chillsword_ which has been planted in the magma itself as an attempt to destroy this artifact in ancient times. Unfortunately for the wielder, not even the melting magma of this plane could destroy the artifact, and instead the blade formed a cooled area where a settlement would eventually rise around. While the [[Places/Cosmology/Planes of Existance/Inner Planes/Elemental Planes/Plane of Air|Plane of Air]] is still dangerous and filled with toxins, ambitious travelers who were searching for a respite from this plane took a liking to this area and would eventually form a large city, creating strange breathing devices that transform the toxins of this plane into breathable [[Places/Cosmology/Planes of Existance/Inner Planes/Elemental Planes/Plane of Air|Plane of Air]]. 

### Targath’s Tower
While not a wizard himself, Targath Reniume had commissioned over a dozen powerful wizards to construct for him a tower on Magma. Some believe that he paid them with illicit goods that he had acquired, with the most unbelievable rumors that he had stolen the _moaning diamond_ and gave it to them. This tower is made out of permanent _walls of force_, making it an invisible tower in the churning magma. It rises several stories above the plane of Magma and far below it where it is anchored to the lava tube network that crisscrosses the plane. 

He is happy to allow visitors to rest at his home, often only requiring news of the world outside for a comfortable bed and a lavish supper. No one is quite sure how Targath moves from his tower and out into the many worlds outside, but he seems to be able to travel with a care-free demeanor and can almost will himself to appear anywhere in the multiverse.
