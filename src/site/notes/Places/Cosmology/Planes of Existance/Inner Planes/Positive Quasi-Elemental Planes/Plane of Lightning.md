# Lightning
[[Places/Cosmology/Planes of Existance/Inner Planes/Positive Quasi-Elemental Planes/Positive Quasi-Elemental Planes|Positive Quasi-Elemental Planes]]
### Lightning: An Outsider’s Perspective
Travelers are greeted with a world alight with lightning and energy. The sky is crowded with black clouds and arcs of lightning. The entire plane smells of ozone while bolts leap from cloud to cloud and touching anything in this world is enough to cause static shock to explode out. A glowing brilliance, known as St. Elmo’s [[Places/Cosmology/Planes of Existance/Inner Planes/Elemental Planes/Plane of Fire|Plane of Fire]], coats everything that visits the plane, giving every creature an electrical brilliance. The biggest secret to survival on this plane is to avoid bringing any metal as even a dagger is enough to attract the elemental energies of this plane, turning the traveler into a lightning rod.

### Lightning: A Native’s Perspective
The natives of Lightning are largely lightning elementals, though there are a few others who soar through these storm skies. There are even creatures, the Uun, whose entire life cycle starts and ends in the flash of lightning that arcs through the sky. Many of the creatures found here take on the form of lightning, making it hard to discern what is a living lightning bolt and what is a natural construction of the plane, with many believing that every lightning bolt is sentient and alive. Some outsiders have lived here so long as to understand the dark of this plane, though they are rare and reside in the center of the plane on a small mote of [[Places/Cosmology/Planes of Existance/Inner Planes/Elemental Planes/Plane of Earth|Plane of Earth]].

## Traits
### Lightning: Atmosphere
Arcs of lightning fill this world and any metal immediately begins building up charges and attracting lightning to it. The atmosphere is breathable, though it tastes like burnt ozone with a tang. So long as travelers aren’t wearing metal, they probably won’t get struck by lightning often though certain spells are needed to help ward them from harm.

### Lightning: Traversing the Plane
With arcs of lightning and balls of electricity that chase after living creatures, traveling the plane is often thought to be a death sentence. Those who journey here, and wish to travel, must take a lot of precautions to protect themselves and their equipment from the hazards of this plane. Most planewalkers simply discard any metal items, instead, bringing in wood swords and leather armor to protect them from building up too much static in the plane. Those who choose to bring metal objects attract lightning immediately upon entering the planes, and those who survive a bolt, or several, find themselves walking around with metal objects increasing in static charge. Simply touching or brushing the metal is enough to set it off and a massive eruption of energy soon follows, often destroying everything and everyone nearby as a blast of lightning, thunder, force, and [[Places/Cosmology/Planes of Existance/Inner Planes/Elemental Planes/Plane of Fire|Plane of Fire]] explodes out.

Once a traveler has arrived on this plane, and survived, the next problem they face is the cacophony of this realm as peals of lightning are soon followed by the rumbles of thunder. This plane is full of thunder, shaking and booming across the plane, causing creatures to become deaf, and it has even been known to cause some to implode from the vibrations. To properly travel through the plane, travelers need thick earplugs of wax shoved into the ears to help reduce the noise, which unfortunately makes them deaf to their companions. 

Finally, a traveler is now ready to traverse the plane. To travel across the plane, it is the same as the Plane of [[Places/Cosmology/Planes of Existance/Inner Planes/Elemental Planes/Plane of Air|Plane of Air]] where you determine your gravity and fall to your destination. This type of travel can be awful for those unused to it, though there is less material in Lightning than in the Plane of [[Places/Cosmology/Planes of Existance/Inner Planes/Elemental Planes/Plane of Air|Plane of Air]] so the chance of hitting something as you fall is greatly diminished.

## Lightning: Locations
![[image-asset-9.jpeg]]
Lightning shares borders with the Positive Energy Plane, [[Places/Cosmology/Planes of Existance/Inner Planes/Positive Quasi-Elemental Planes/Plane of Steam|Plane of Steam]], [[Places/Cosmology/Planes of Existance/Inner Planes/Para Elemental Planes/Plane of Ice|Plane of Ice]], the Plane of [[Places/Cosmology/Planes of Existance/Inner Planes/Elemental Planes/Plane of Air|Plane of Air]], [[Places/Cosmology/Planes of Existance/Inner Planes/Para Elemental Planes/Plane of Smoke|Plane of Smoke]], and [[Places/Cosmology/Planes of Existance/Inner Planes/Positive Quasi-Elemental Planes/Plane of Radiance|Plane of Radiance]], each creating a unique interaction with the erratic energy of Lightning. [[Places/Cosmology/Planes of Existance/Inner Planes/Positive Quasi-Elemental Planes/Plane of Steam|Plane of Steam]] and [[Places/Cosmology/Planes of Existance/Inner Planes/Para Elemental Planes/Plane of Smoke|Plane of Smoke]] both create an area of electrical fog that sparks with deadly energy and makes it difficult for creatures to see further than a few inches in front of their face, these two areas are both known as the Dark Land. The space near the Plane of [[Places/Cosmology/Planes of Existance/Inner Planes/Elemental Planes/Plane of Air|Plane of Air]] is known as the Subdued Cacophony where there is more space between the dark thunder clouds and less errant bolts of lightning. As an opposite, where Lightning adjoins the Positive Energy Plane, the realm is known as the Wall of Energy where a physical barrier of lightning exists like a wall to the next plane.

[[Places/Cosmology/Planes of Existance/Inner Planes/Para Elemental Planes/Plane of Ice|Plane of Ice]] and Lightning create the realm known as Glistening Crystal where solidified [[Places/Cosmology/Planes of Existance/Inner Planes/Para Elemental Planes/Plane of Ice|Plane of Ice]] crystals of lightning crackle with the green energy of lightning ready to explode out. Bright [[Places/Cosmology/Planes of Existance/Inner Planes/Para Elemental Planes/Plane of Ice|Plane of Ice]], a rare material, can be mined from these [[Places/Cosmology/Planes of Existance/Inner Planes/Para Elemental Planes/Plane of Ice|Plane of Ice]] glaciers though it is incredibly dangerous to get ahold of and transport safely off the plane. Where Lightning reaches [[Places/Cosmology/Planes of Existance/Inner Planes/Positive Quasi-Elemental Planes/Plane of Radiance|Plane of Radiance]], it creates the Bright Land, a region of the plane where it resembles the inner portion but the clouds themselves glow a dazzling array of different colors. 

While Lightning is a massive storm cloud, there are a few important locations that all planewalkers should be aware of in their travels. 

### The Eye

Located near the center of this plane is a place of quiet and peace. Generations ago, some powerful individual was able to use their magic to quiet the plane and create a small area of peace. In this peace is a large [[Places/Cosmology/Planes of Existance/Inner Planes/Elemental Planes/Plane of Earth|Plane of Earth]] mote where a small town has formed, welcoming outsiders who need a respite from the cacophony of Lightning.

### The Tower of Storms

Located in the region known as the Wall of Energy, where Lightning abuts against the Positive Energy Plane, this tower has a glistening blue hue that crackles with electricity and bursts through the barrier between the planes. No entrance has been found, and no one has been able to enter the tower, at least no one is telling if they had. Even the elementals of the plane know little about this structure but are convinced it must hold powerful sway over Lightning.
