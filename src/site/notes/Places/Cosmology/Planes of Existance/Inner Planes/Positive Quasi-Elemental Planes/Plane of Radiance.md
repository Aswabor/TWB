# Radiance
[[Places/Cosmology/Planes of Existance/Inner Planes/Positive Quasi-Elemental Planes/Positive Quasi-Elemental Planes|Positive Quasi-Elemental Planes]]
### Radiance: An Outsider’s Perspective
Beautiful and made of pure color, this plane is of an aching and burning beauty. Radiance is the mixing of the Positive Energy Plane and the Plane of [[Places/Cosmology/Planes of Existance/Inner Planes/Elemental Planes/Plane of Fire|Plane of Fire]], creating a burning, cleansing energy that glows and burns in painful splendor. Every color can be found glistening in this realm of energy, with colors swirling in a dazzling display. There is a price to witnessing the beauty of this plane, as anyone who visits goes blind from the Radiance unless they can properly prepare for their trek into the plane.

### Radiance: A Native’s Perspective
The beings of Radiance must be able to survive the erratic energies of the Positive Energy Plane, as well as the burning heat of the Plane of [[Places/Cosmology/Planes of Existance/Inner Planes/Elemental Planes/Plane of Fire|Plane of Fire]]. This radiance isn’t simply hot, but its blinding beauty is enough to burn out those unworthy travelers who would travel to this plane. The quasielementals who reside here are aloof, even with each other, and rarely choose to make themselves known to outsiders. While the people of Radiance rarely ever leave, several distinct groups reside on this plane.

The Varisoh, a group of bird-like humanoids who live in a place known as the Refuge of Color where two regal figures, King Black and Queen White, watch over them. It is said that the two are powerful and have godlike powers. Apart from them are the inhabitants of the Kingdom of the Blind, occupied solely by outsiders who have journeyed to this plane and refuse to leave. Thanks to the protection of their home, they are not blinded by the beauty of the plane. 

Efreet also journey to this plane, though the inhabitants despise them. The only outsiders the inhabitants like, at least a little, are the celestials who pilgrimage to this plane. Devas, solars, holiphants, and more journey to this plane to witness the splendor of Radiance.

## Traits
### Radiance: Atmosphere
Brilliant lights blind all creatures who journey here unless they take the necessary precautions to protect their eyes. Those who are resistant or immune to the heat of Radiance, which is dependent on the edition if it is simply [[Places/Cosmology/Planes of Existance/Inner Planes/Elemental Planes/Plane of Fire|Plane of Fire]] or radiant damage, can look upon this world without going blind. Others must cover their eyes in thick bandages that can protect their eyes from the intense light of the plane. A common tactic by many is to cast _darkness_ on themselves before they enter the plane, as the spell makes the plane around them just dark enough that they can see without going blind.

### Radiance: Traversing the Plane
Unlike the Plane of [[Places/Cosmology/Planes of Existance/Inner Planes/Elemental Planes/Plane of Fire|Plane of Fire]], which has a super-dense layer of [[Places/Cosmology/Planes of Existance/Inner Planes/Elemental Planes/Plane of Fire|Plane of Fire]] to walk upon, Radiance is more like the Plane of [[Places/Cosmology/Planes of Existance/Inner Planes/Elemental Planes/Plane of Air|Plane of Air]] and [[Places/Cosmology/Planes of Existance/Inner Planes/Positive Quasi-Elemental Planes/Plane of Lightning|Plane of Lightning]]. A creature must simply decide which way is their down and travel in that direction. Inhabitants of this realm have no understanding of gravity and find creatures who ‘fall’ to travel the plane as being ridiculous and lacking. For them, traveling the plane is simply done by existing and that by existing, they can move across their home plane. Planewalkers will often compare their movement to be similar to flying, though they have no wings or visible signs of levitation.

Of course, traveling across Radiance is all for not if the traveler is blinded by the radiance of this plane. Creatures must wear thick padding over their eyes, cast _darkness_ on themselves, or wear special lenses over their eyes to block out as much radiance as possible - these obstructions can’t stop all light and so while a creature might be blindfolded, light still pierces through and they can make out dark shapes against a painfully bright background. Planewalkers have discovered that certain smoky gems from [[Places/Cosmology/Planes of Existance/Inner Planes/Positive Quasi-Elemental Planes/Plane of Mineral|Plane of Mineral]] can be crafted into lens caps that can be worn over the eyes, these special gems can block out almost all of the radiance and allow a creature to see as normal in the plane. Unfortunately, they are quite delicate and if a traveler gets into a fight, they can be knocked off or destroyed by such quick movements.

## Radiance: Locations
![[Radiance_Borders_InnerPlanes.webp]]
Radiance shares borders with the Positive Energy Plane, [[Places/Cosmology/Planes of Existance/Inner Planes/Positive Quasi-Elemental Planes/Plane of Lightning|Plane of Lightning]], [[Places/Cosmology/Planes of Existance/Inner Planes/Para Elemental Planes/Plane of Smoke|Plane of Smoke]], the Plane of [[Places/Cosmology/Planes of Existance/Inner Planes/Elemental Planes/Plane of Fire|Plane of Fire]], [[Places/Cosmology/Planes of Existance/Inner Planes/Para Elemental Planes/Plane of Magma|Plane of Magma]], and [[Places/Cosmology/Planes of Existance/Inner Planes/Positive Quasi-Elemental Planes/Plane of Mineral|Plane of Mineral]], each creating a unique interaction with the burning radiant energy of Radiance. [[Places/Cosmology/Planes of Existance/Inner Planes/Positive Quasi-Elemental Planes/Plane of Lightning|Plane of Lightning]] creates the Bright Land, a region of the plane of radiant clouds and [[Places/Cosmology/Planes of Existance/Inner Planes/Positive Quasi-Elemental Planes/Plane of Lightning|Plane of Lightning]]. [[Places/Cosmology/Planes of Existance/Inner Planes/Para Elemental Planes/Plane of Smoke|Plane of Smoke]] creates the Sea of Stars, thick clouds of smog with twinkling stars of radiant energy burning through. 

The space near the Plane of [[Places/Cosmology/Planes of Existance/Inner Planes/Elemental Planes/Plane of Fire|Plane of Fire]] is known as Brightflame, a region of [[Places/Cosmology/Planes of Existance/Inner Planes/Elemental Planes/Plane of Fire|Plane of Fire]] in such varied colors that it appears as a rainbow of flame. As an opposite, where Radiance meets the Positive Energy Plane, it creates the region known as the Light, a place of healing and brilliant illumination. The realm holds such influence of positive energy that wounds themselves can heal, though not as quickly as the energy plane itself. 

[[Places/Cosmology/Planes of Existance/Inner Planes/Para Elemental Planes/Plane of Magma|Plane of Magma]] and Radiance create the realm known as the Glowing Dunes, molten lava that gives off a radiant glow of energy. Where Radiance reaches [[Places/Cosmology/Planes of Existance/Inner Planes/Positive Quasi-Elemental Planes/Plane of Mineral|Plane of Mineral]], it creates Brighthome, a realm of glowing crystals where the Kingdom of the Blind can be found. 

While little is defined about Radiance, those who travel to this plane are meet with such intense light and colors that it can be difficult to truly define where you are on this plane.

### The Kingdom of the Blind

This city occupies Brighthome, the border between [[Places/Cosmology/Planes of Existance/Inner Planes/Positive Quasi-Elemental Planes/Plane of Mineral|Plane of Mineral]] and Radiance. The city is formed inside of a massive [[Places/Cosmology/Planes of Existance/Inner Planes/Positive Quasi-Elemental Planes/Plane of Mineral|Plane of Mineral]] and is difficult to locate. This [[Places/Cosmology/Planes of Existance/Inner Planes/Positive Quasi-Elemental Planes/Plane of Mineral|Plane of Mineral]] also acts as a shield from the burning light of Radiance, making it a welcome respite for those who occupy the city from the energies of the plane. 

### The Heart of Light

Also known as the Tower of Healing, this tower punches through the borders of the Positive Energy Plane and Radiance, creating a peninsula of radiant ground. This tower is largely abandoned but sees visitors constantly as they journey to this tower to heal curses, wounds, and afflictions. This tower is also studied by mages for it is constructed solely of blue light given physical form, no one has been able to reproduce it.
