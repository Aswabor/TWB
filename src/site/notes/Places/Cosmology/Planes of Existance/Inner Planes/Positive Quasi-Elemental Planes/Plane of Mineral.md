# Mineral
[[Places/Cosmology/Planes of Existance/Inner Planes/Positive Quasi-Elemental Planes/Positive Quasi-Elemental Planes|Positive Quasi-Elemental Planes]]
### Mineral: An Outsider’s Perspective
Thought of as the treasure trove of the multiverse, the plane is made up of brilliant gems, ores, rubies, sapphires, gold, and more with veins of pure metals wrapped around each other like tree roots. Because this plane represents the positive energy of the Plane of [[Places/Cosmology/Planes of Existance/Inner Planes/Elemental Planes/Plane of Earth|Plane of Earth]], it is filled with the positive minerals and materials with pure metal and gems of the finest quality. Despite how easy it is to find such valuable goods, this plane isn’t often visited simply due to the deadliness of it all. This world is filled with razor-sharp edges from gems, ore, metals, and more, cutting and slicing any creature that attempts to move through the world more than a few feet.

### Mineral: A Native’s Perspective
One of the few quasi-elemental planes with an Archomental, Crystalle, who holds claim over the territories of the plane. The inhabitants of this plane are largely the quasielementals of Mineral, though there are also the Tsnng, a race of crystalline creatures who are renowned for their spellcasting and magic. The inhabitants of the plane are typically only encountered by outsiders when they begin trying to take precious gems and ore from the plane, especially in large scale operations like with teams of miners. The inhabitants are constantly having to protect their plane from outsiders looking to get rich quick, and even fighting off the Xorn who travel to this plane from the Plane of [[Places/Cosmology/Planes of Existance/Inner Planes/Elemental Planes/Plane of Earth|Plane of Earth]] and try to devour everything they find. Strangely, the Dao are allowed to take what they want from this plane and are not hassled or destroyed for their greed, making many believe that the Dao are offering something to the Tsnng and Crystalle that allows them such freedoms.

## Traits
### Mineral: Atmosphere
Like the Plane of [[Places/Cosmology/Planes of Existance/Inner Planes/Elemental Planes/Plane of Earth|Plane of Earth]], this plane is almost completely filled with minerals occupying almost every space of this plane, though the difference is that it has no limestone or granite filling in the spaces between gems and ore. [[Places/Cosmology/Planes of Existance/Inner Planes/Elemental Planes/Plane of Air|Plane of Air]] exists in the twisting tunnels, and apart from the deadly razor-sharp edges of this plane, it is easy to survive here.

### Mineral: Traversing the Plane
This plane is solely composed of pure ore and beautiful gems that are so sharp that it slices any creature that walks through the plane. Only twisting tunnels and caverns allow egress through the plane, but luckily those empty spaces are filled with breathable oxygen. If you don’t wish to follow the natural and artificial tunnels that have been mined through the plane, you are forced to dig yourself your own tunnel or have the ability to walk through stone like a Xorn. This is the same process as the Plane of [[Places/Cosmology/Planes of Existance/Inner Planes/Elemental Planes/Plane of Earth|Plane of Earth]], though the Plane of [[Places/Cosmology/Planes of Existance/Inner Planes/Elemental Planes/Plane of Earth|Plane of Earth]] is far less lethal to simply walkthrough.

Sharp edges and crystals extend out from the walls of tunnels and caverns, almost invisible to the naked eye. These edges slash and cut through thick leather, hard metal, and more, cutting creatures and visitors to ribbons simply from walking through the plane. The only way most can travel this plane without being sliced and bleeding out is by wearing thick heavy armor, like full plate, or have magical protections. While planewalkers disagree on how much magical protection is required, they all know that a ring of protection is not going to cut it, but rather you need magically warded armor.

If journeying through a world of sharp and deadly edges isn’t enough to deter visitors, those who spend more than a day here must also save against petrification. Those who are unable to withstand the effects of this plane turn into a perfect statue of crystal.

## Mineral: Locations
![[image-asset-10.jpeg|image-asset-10.jpeg]]
Mineral shares borders with the Positive Energy Plane, [[Places/Cosmology/Planes of Existance/Inner Planes/Positive Quasi-Elemental Planes/Plane of Steam|Plane of Steam]], [[Places/Cosmology/Planes of Existance/Inner Planes/Para Elemental Planes/Plane of Ooze|Plane of Ooze]], the Plane of [[Places/Cosmology/Planes of Existance/Inner Planes/Elemental Planes/Plane of Earth|Plane of Earth]], [[Places/Cosmology/Planes of Existance/Inner Planes/Para Elemental Planes/Plane of Magma|Plane of Magma]], and [[Places/Cosmology/Planes of Existance/Inner Planes/Positive Quasi-Elemental Planes/Plane of Radiance|Plane of Radiance]], each creating a unique interaction with the crystalline structures of Mineral. [[Places/Cosmology/Planes of Existance/Inner Planes/Positive Quasi-Elemental Planes/Plane of Steam|Plane of Steam]] creates the realm known as the Misty Caverns choked with thick mists and fog. [[Places/Cosmology/Planes of Existance/Inner Planes/Para Elemental Planes/Plane of Ooze|Plane of Ooze]], also known as the Plane of Mud, creates the glistening, underground sea of mud and crystals that float through the thick ocean known as Sparklemire. It is rarely traveled as it is a slog to move through the mud, and even if you do, the crystals will slice you into ribbons.

The space near the Plane of [[Places/Cosmology/Planes of Existance/Inner Planes/Elemental Planes/Plane of Earth|Plane of Earth]] is called the Unnamed Border as it is impossible to tell where one ends and where the other begins, it just a massive sheet of stone and rock with caverns and tunnels dotted throughout. As an opposite, where Mineral adjoins the Positive Energy Plane, the realm is known as the Gemfields where the gems begin glowing. The closer you travel to the energy plane, the less gems there are, and the more they glow until they become stars glistening in the void. 

[[Places/Cosmology/Planes of Existance/Inner Planes/Para Elemental Planes/Plane of Magma|Plane of Magma]] and Mineral create the realm known as the Natural Forge which is filled with precious metals but they only exist in the state of molten ore. Those who can survive the intense heat can pull forth such pure metals that when fashioned into jewelry or weapons, take on a supernatural beauty of their own. Where Mineral reaches [[Places/Cosmology/Planes of Existance/Inner Planes/Positive Quasi-Elemental Planes/Plane of Radiance|Plane of Radiance]], it creates the Brighthome, a realm similar to Gemfields where the gems are less deadly and instead glow with radiant energies. The vast majority of outsiders choose to make their home here as it is far safer than in the dangerous depths of the rest of the plane. 

There are not a large number of sites on Mineral, and those that exist are defined by what ore or gems are in abundance.

### The Tower of Lead

This tower is massive and gray, jutting up through the borders of the Positive Energy Plane and Mineral, uniting the two together over a thin peninsula of minerals. Inside the tower is the best forge in the multiverse, at least according to dwarven legend, which is blasphemy to many dwarves as Moradin claims to have the best. While no one knows who built the place, it is largely abandoned and those who work the forge only stay for a short while. Those who decide to stay longer mysteriously disappear and no one has puzzled out where they leave to. There are also tools and machines inside the tower whose purpose is unknown, though they were built by someone for some specific reason. Many believe that these tools are meant for the technology yet to come and some dwarves have tried experimenting with the tools to little success. No matter how hard the dwarves have tried, no one has been able to steal the tools from this tower.
