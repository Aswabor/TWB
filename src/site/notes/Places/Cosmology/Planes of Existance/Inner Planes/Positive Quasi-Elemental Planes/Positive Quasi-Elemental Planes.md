# What are the Positive Quasi-Elemental Planes?
Between the major Inner Planes are the positive quasi-elemental planes that bridge the gap between them and the Positive Energy Plane. Four quasi-elemental planes blend the pure energy of Positive with the elements, creating worlds of agitating elements that are often as deadly as they are beautiful. The four planes are [[Places/Cosmology/Planes of Existance/Inner Planes/Positive Quasi-Elemental Planes/Plane of Lightning|Plane of Lightning]], [[Places/Cosmology/Planes of Existance/Inner Planes/Positive Quasi-Elemental Planes/Plane of Radiance|Plane of Radiance]], [[Places/Cosmology/Planes of Existance/Inner Planes/Positive Quasi-Elemental Planes/Plane of Mineral|Plane of Mineral]], and [[Places/Cosmology/Planes of Existance/Inner Planes/Positive Quasi-Elemental Planes/Plane of Steam|Plane of Steam]], each adjoins a different elemental plane of [[Places/Cosmology/Planes of Existance/Inner Planes/Elemental Planes/Plane of Air|Plane of Air]], [[Places/Cosmology/Planes of Existance/Inner Planes/Elemental Planes/Plane of Fire|Plane of Fire]], [[Places/Cosmology/Planes of Existance/Inner Planes/Elemental Planes/Plane of Earth|Plane of Earth]], and [[Places/Cosmology/Planes of Existance/Inner Planes/Elemental Planes/Plane of Water|Plane of Water]], respectively. 

These planes are crackling with energy and its occupants are just as full of life as the plane. Unfortunately, for many travelers, these planes are just as dangerous as the Positive Energy Plane and pose very real risks for those who visit them.

## History
The positive quasi-elemental planes are first introduced in the _Manual of the Planes (1987)_ where the foundations of each are laid. This book provides the reader with information on how deadly these planes are and their relationship to the Inner Planes as well as the Positive Energy Plane. It isn’t until _The Inner Planes (1998)_ is released though that additional detail is provided on the inhabitants and specific places to explore. Unfortunately, little information is actually known about these planes. 

## An Outsider’s Perspective
Survival in any of these planes is difficult for the ill-prepared. Not only do travelers have to overcome the challenges of the major element that each quasi-plane represents, but they are energized by the Positive Energy Plane, creating agitated realms of chaotic energy.

## A Native’s Perspective
Creatures of these planes exist, though they are rare and typically don’t like leaving their home plane without good reason. These creatures are based on the elements of their planes, overflowing with energy from the Positive Energy Plane, and are often thought to be bubbly and over the top. Very few powers make their home on these planes, though they are often visited by many gods who simply wish to re-attune themselves to a specific element, like storm gods who visit [[Places/Cosmology/Planes of Existance/Inner Planes/Positive Quasi-Elemental Planes/Plane of Lightning|Plane of Lightning]].

## Atmosphere
The atmosphere on these planes is akin to the major elemental plane that they represent, though they introduce their risks. Every plane is breathable, though in the case of [[Places/Cosmology/Planes of Existance/Inner Planes/Positive Quasi-Elemental Planes/Plane of Mineral|Plane of Mineral]], there just might not be much to breathe as it is made of solid ore and gems, like the Plane of [[Places/Cosmology/Planes of Existance/Inner Planes/Elemental Planes/Plane of Earth|Plane of Earth]], and there are only pockets and tunnels to travel through. These planes can support life, though each has its own unique dangers associated with them.

# Traits
## Travel to the Planes
Traveling to these planes is not too difficult, though it isn’t as easy as traveling to one of the major Inner Planes. There are known portals that link to these planes, as well as vortices that suddenly spring up where their element is strongest. While portals are commonly used by many travelers, you can also hire guides from the major planes and they can take you across the planar boundaries that separate their plane from one of the quasi-elemental planes. The borders at these intersections of planes can be quite dangerous, but with a trusted guide, it isn’t too difficult to get across them, of course, the guide may only know where the border is and not be able to help navigate you across the new plane. 

The most common portals appear in places that are linked to the planes, and of course, [[Places/Cosmology/Planes of Existance/Outer Planes/Outlands/Sigil|Sigil]] holds at least one portal to each of these planes, but they can be constantly changing their location as the mood comes. Portals are often guarded by creatures who embody some form of that element, like Storm Gods on the Outlands have laid claim on a series of portals to [[Places/Cosmology/Planes of Existance/Inner Planes/Positive Quasi-Elemental Planes/Plane of Lightning|Plane of Lightning]], or a group of dwarven miners, also on the Outlands, have laid claim to a portal to [[Places/Cosmology/Planes of Existance/Inner Planes/Positive Quasi-Elemental Planes/Plane of Mineral|Plane of Mineral]]. Celestials feverishly guard a portal to [[Places/Cosmology/Planes of Existance/Inner Planes/Positive Quasi-Elemental Planes/Plane of Radiance|Plane of Radiance]] from fiends trying to unlock the power of radiant energy, while [[Places/Cosmology/Planes of Existance/Inner Planes/Positive Quasi-Elemental Planes/Plane of Steam|Plane of Steam]] might be located at the bottom of Aquallor on Arborea. 

Vortices, quick and temporary portals that are often only one way, often form at points of large gatherings of elements. [[Places/Cosmology/Planes of Existance/Inner Planes/Positive Quasi-Elemental Planes/Plane of Lightning|Plane of Lightning]] storms on the Prime Material Plane could be a bridging point for [[Places/Cosmology/Planes of Existance/Inner Planes/Positive Quasi-Elemental Planes/Plane of Lightning|Plane of Lightning]], while many Prime Suns are thought to spawn vortices on their surface to [[Places/Cosmology/Planes of Existance/Inner Planes/Positive Quasi-Elemental Planes/Plane of Radiance|Plane of Radiance]]. [[Places/Cosmology/Planes of Existance/Inner Planes/Positive Quasi-Elemental Planes/Plane of Mineral|Plane of Mineral]] also creates vortices when massive amounts of brilliant gems and pure ore are gathered together, while [[Places/Cosmology/Planes of Existance/Inner Planes/Positive Quasi-Elemental Planes/Plane of Steam|Plane of Steam]] often appears in dense, massive fogs that are so thick as to be impossible to see through.

Another popular method of traveling to these planes is by using the [[Places/Cosmology/Planes of Existance/Inner Planes/Ethereal Plane|Ethereal Plane]] and traveling through the Deep Ethereal until you find a quasi-elemental plane’s color curtain and stepping through. Most Border Ethereals for these planes are relatively safe, apart from the standard inhabitants of the [[Places/Cosmology/Planes of Existance/Inner Planes/Ethereal Plane|Ethereal Plane]], though there can be errant bolts of [[Places/Cosmology/Planes of Existance/Inner Planes/Positive Quasi-Elemental Planes/Plane of Lightning|Plane of Lightning]] that suddenly appear on [[Places/Cosmology/Planes of Existance/Inner Planes/Positive Quasi-Elemental Planes/Plane of Lightning|Plane of Lightning]]’s Border Ethereal, just as thick fog might seep into the [[Places/Cosmology/Planes of Existance/Inner Planes/Positive Quasi-Elemental Planes/Plane of Steam|Plane of Steam]]’s Border Ethereal and threaten to drown anyone there.

## Traversing the Planes
Traversing these planes is difficult for those unprepared, and it isn’t solely because of the inhabitants or the elemental nature of these planes. The planes are so agitated with energy that they can have secondary effects that make staying in them for an extended period of time quite dangerous. While moving across these planes is similar to how it works on the major plane they are part of, it does come with its problems.

# Locations
Despite the dangerous and hostile atmospheres of these planes, there are many settlements and reasons for visiting each of these planes. Because these planes connect the Positive Energy Plane with a major elemental plane, they provide a bridge of sorts between the two and are often visited by travelers hoping to go from one to the other. Also, every plane that borders the Positive Energy Plane has a tower made of its substance created by an unknown being eons ago. These towers pierce into the Positive Energy Plane and provide peninsulas into the plane of relatively safe spaces. 

Where the planes border another, it’s difficult to tell where one plane ends and the other begins, and instead, these borders are split across the planes. When describing a realm of [[Places/Cosmology/Planes of Existance/Inner Planes/Positive Quasi-Elemental Planes/Plane of Radiance|Plane of Radiance]] and [[Places/Cosmology/Planes of Existance/Inner Planes/Positive Quasi-Elemental Planes/Plane of Mineral|Plane of Mineral]], known as Brighthome, it’s not restricted to a single plane but rather acts to adjoin the two planes and stretches between them.

# Factions & People
## The Powers
Only one power claims a domain in these Positive Quasi-Elemental Planes, and that is the powers known as King Black and Queen White located on [[Places/Cosmology/Planes of Existance/Inner Planes/Positive Quasi-Elemental Planes/Plane of Radiance|Plane of Radiance]]. Many other powers will journey to these planes simply to reattune themselves to those energies, or if they are searching for something specific within the planes, but no other had decided to make their realm here. It could be that since the Inner Planes are focused on existence, and less on beliefs, that they just find it too difficult to reach their worshippers and petitioners on these planes.

### Archomental
While they are not truly a power, or godlike being, the Archomental on [[Places/Cosmology/Planes of Existance/Inner Planes/Positive Quasi-Elemental Planes/Plane of Mineral|Plane of Mineral]], known as Crystalle, holds a small domain throughout the plane. Its tower is made of crystalline structures and an army of crystal elementals guards it against outside forces.

## Quasielementals
These elementals are known as quasielementals by sages and researchers of the planes, though the elementals themselves don’t refer to themselves as such. They are thought to be the plane given sentience and are often summoned by the spellcasters looking to trap elemental energies or control elementals in battle. Most of these elementals that walk their plane are simply the animals of their planes, creating the birds, vermin, and natural beasts in varying displays of elements. From radiant rats of dazzling colors to [[Places/Cosmology/Planes of Existance/Inner Planes/Positive Quasi-Elemental Planes/Plane of Lightning|Plane of Lightning]] birds crackling with energy to the mist deer that gallop through the clouds of fog, these creatures have a natural place in their ecosystems. 

# Encounters
**Djinni’s Hunt -** A djinni is planning on going on a great hunt through the [[Places/Cosmology/Planes of Existance/Inner Planes/Positive Quasi-Elemental Planes/Plane of Lightning|Plane of Lightning]] plane and is inviting a large number of individuals to join him. He is hoping to bring down a massive, ancient blue dragon who has made their roost in the [[Places/Cosmology/Planes of Existance/Inner Planes/Positive Quasi-Elemental Planes/Plane of Lightning|Plane of Lightning]] storms. While the djinni has some skills, he is hoping for the party to weaken the beast for him so that he might land the killing blow and show off his victory to the other djinni nobles.

**Cursed Existence -** A party member has been cursed with festering wounds and no spell has worked. Rumors of the Tower of Healing has spurned them to traveling through [[Places/Cosmology/Planes of Existance/Inner Planes/Positive Quasi-Elemental Planes/Plane of Radiance|Plane of Radiance]] in search of its healing energies.

**Miners of [[Places/Cosmology/Planes of Existance/Inner Planes/Positive Quasi-Elemental Planes/Plane of Mineral|Plane of Mineral]] -** A team of dwarves are heading out into the [[Places/Cosmology/Planes of Existance/Inner Planes/Positive Quasi-Elemental Planes/Plane of Mineral|Plane of Mineral]] plane and are looking for stalwart defenders who can protect them from [[Places/Cosmology/Planes of Existance/Inner Planes/Positive Quasi-Elemental Planes/Plane of Mineral|Plane of Mineral]] Elementals, Xorns, and other foul creatures that dislike them taking gems from the plane.

**Xanxost -** Xanxost, a slaad, is looking for tasty mephits to eat. Unfortunately, Xanxost is having problem as all the mephits keep running away from him in [[Places/Cosmology/Planes of Existance/Inner Planes/Positive Quasi-Elemental Planes/Plane of Steam|Plane of Steam]]. Xanxost is having difficulties as the mephits keep running for protection behind larger [[Places/Cosmology/Planes of Existance/Inner Planes/Positive Quasi-Elemental Planes/Plane of Steam|Plane of Steam]] creatures and Xanxost can’t eat them. Xanxost looking for adventurers to kill big [[Places/Cosmology/Planes of Existance/Inner Planes/Positive Quasi-Elemental Planes/Plane of Steam|Plane of Steam]] elemental, then Xanxost can eat mephits.
