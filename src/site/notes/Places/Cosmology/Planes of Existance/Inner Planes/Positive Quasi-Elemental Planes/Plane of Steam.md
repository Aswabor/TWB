### Steam: An Outsider’s Perspective
This plane, despite its name, is surprisingly cool and many believe that calling it Mist would be a better name for it. This mist is clammy and thick, seeping into everything and drenching it completely. While there are pockets of superheated [[Places/Cosmology/Planes of Existance/Inner Planes/Elemental Planes/Plane of Water|Plane of Water]], it isn’t the biggest danger that travelers should be mindful of, instead, it is drowning on the plane. The mist is so thick and prevalent that every time a creature breathes, they are also breathing in lungfuls of [[Places/Cosmology/Planes of Existance/Inner Planes/Elemental Planes/Plane of Water|Plane of Water]], choking on flooded lungs.

### Steam: A Native’s Perspective
Steam holds a variety of natural creatures who appeared in the mists of this plane. The most common are the elementals of this plane, though they are incredibly hard to see as they are mist themselves, allowing them to blend into the plane almost seamlessly. The easiest way of locating these elementals is to look for their communities as they constantly trade with the Marids for slaves for unknown purposes. 

Apart from the elementals are the Faberes, gigantic balloonlike creatures who propel themselves through the plane by breathing out gases, the Javoose and Calden, which appear to be large [[Places/Cosmology/Planes of Existance/Inner Planes/Elemental Planes/Plane of Water|Plane of Water]] bugs that flit across the plane in search of food, and the Klyndesi and Wavefires who also appear like steam or mist in strange forms. The Klyndesi are dangerous to outsiders as they hunt the Fabere and travelers, while the Wavefires simply hunt the plane for dry [[Places/Cosmology/Planes of Existance/Inner Planes/Elemental Planes/Plane of Air|Plane of Air]] and don’t bother attacking other creatures.

## Traits
### Steam: Atmosphere
While this plane is breathable, it is like breathing in heavy fog and mists that fill up your lungs with [[Places/Cosmology/Planes of Existance/Inner Planes/Elemental Planes/Plane of Water|Plane of Water]]. The only way to survive in this plane is if you can naturally breathe in [[Places/Cosmology/Planes of Existance/Inner Planes/Elemental Planes/Plane of Water|Plane of Water]] or [[Places/Cosmology/Planes of Existance/Inner Planes/Elemental Planes/Plane of Air|Plane of Air]], or you have a _[[Places/Cosmology/Planes of Existance/Inner Planes/Elemental Planes/Plane of Water|Plane of Water]] breathing_ spell cast on you. Many unprepared travelers have drowned on the [[Places/Cosmology/Planes of Existance/Inner Planes/Elemental Planes/Plane of Air|Plane of Air]] of this plane, their lungs so full of [[Places/Cosmology/Planes of Existance/Inner Planes/Elemental Planes/Plane of Water|Plane of Water]] that they burst.

### Steam: Traversing the Plane
Traversing Steam can be done in a variety of ways based on the abilities of the traveler. Due to how thick the [[Places/Cosmology/Planes of Existance/Inner Planes/Elemental Planes/Plane of Air|Plane of Air]] is with [[Places/Cosmology/Planes of Existance/Inner Planes/Elemental Planes/Plane of Water|Plane of Water]], creatures can easily swim through the [[Places/Cosmology/Planes of Existance/Inner Planes/Elemental Planes/Plane of Air|Plane of Air]], almost like they were flying, while other creatures can treat the plane much like the Plane of [[Places/Cosmology/Planes of Existance/Inner Planes/Elemental Planes/Plane of Air|Plane of Air]] and decide on a new down for them to fall in, though it is slower like they were falling through an ocean. Birds and other creatures with wings can fly through the fogs, and the most common method of traveling is using steamships. 

Steamships are large objects that are similar to airships in that they have a large balloon with a carriage of metal or wood strapped to the bottom of the balloon. Unlike an airship though, they don’t use rare gases to levitate the creation but have captured, or trained, steam mephits to release steam into the balloon. Once the balloon is full, the pilot of the steamship can release the steam and the ship moves at frightening speeds across the plane. Occasionally, Fagere might act as the balloons with carriages constructed below them and act as large whales that taxi creatures across the plane.

## Steam: Locations
![[image-asset-11.jpeg]]
Steam shares borders with the Positive Energy Plane, [[Places/Cosmology/Planes of Existance/Inner Planes/Positive Quasi-Elemental Planes/Plane of Mineral|Plane of Mineral]], [[Places/Cosmology/Planes of Existance/Inner Planes/Para Elemental Planes/Plane of Ooze|Plane of Ooze]], the Plane of [[Places/Cosmology/Planes of Existance/Inner Planes/Elemental Planes/Plane of Water|Plane of Water]], [[Places/Cosmology/Planes of Existance/Inner Planes/Para Elemental Planes/Plane of Ice|Plane of Ice]], and [[Places/Cosmology/Planes of Existance/Inner Planes/Positive Quasi-Elemental Planes/Plane of Lightning|Plane of Lightning]], each creating a unique interaction with the mists of Steam. [[Places/Cosmology/Planes of Existance/Inner Planes/Positive Quasi-Elemental Planes/Plane of Mineral|Plane of Mineral]] creates the realm known as the Shard Forest, crystals of all sizes float through dense fog, with the tiniest of the gems sharp enough to slice through tough leather armor. [[Places/Cosmology/Planes of Existance/Inner Planes/Para Elemental Planes/Plane of Ooze|Plane of Ooze]], also known as the Plane of Mud, creates the Realm of Cloying Fear, a place of nothing but a thick atmosphere of stench and oily [[Places/Cosmology/Planes of Existance/Inner Planes/Elemental Planes/Plane of Air|Plane of Air]] unfit for breathing. 

The space near the Plane of [[Places/Cosmology/Planes of Existance/Inner Planes/Elemental Planes/Plane of Water|Plane of Water]] is called the Islands of [[Places/Cosmology/Planes of Existance/Inner Planes/Elemental Planes/Plane of Water|Plane of Water]] where the plane is more [[Places/Cosmology/Planes of Existance/Inner Planes/Elemental Planes/Plane of Water|Plane of Water]] than [[Places/Cosmology/Planes of Existance/Inner Planes/Elemental Planes/Plane of Air|Plane of Air]] and bubbles exist between massives droplets of [[Places/Cosmology/Planes of Existance/Inner Planes/Elemental Planes/Plane of Water|Plane of Water]]. As travelers move further away from the Plane of [[Places/Cosmology/Planes of Existance/Inner Planes/Elemental Planes/Plane of Water|Plane of Water]], these droplets get smaller and smaller until they become a fine mist. As an opposite, where Steam adjoins the Positive Energy Plane, the realm is known as the Raging Mists where the droplets are so incredibly tiny it is like a super fine mist that radiates brilliant light. 

[[Places/Cosmology/Planes of Existance/Inner Planes/Para Elemental Planes/Plane of Ice|Plane of Ice]] and Steam create the realm known as the Hoarfrost where a freezing mist coats everything in a layer of [[Places/Cosmology/Planes of Existance/Inner Planes/Para Elemental Planes/Plane of Ice|Plane of Ice]]. This region is overrun with [[Places/Cosmology/Planes of Existance/Inner Planes/Para Elemental Planes/Plane of Ice|Plane of Ice]] and steam mephits fighting to gain control of the realm. Where Steam reaches [[Places/Cosmology/Planes of Existance/Inner Planes/Positive Quasi-Elemental Planes/Plane of Lightning|Plane of Lightning]], it creates the Death Cloud, with large clouds carrying massive electrical charges that blast apart any creature, [[Places/Cosmology/Planes of Existance/Inner Planes/Positive Quasi-Elemental Planes/Plane of Mineral|Plane of Mineral]], or object that gets too close to them. 

While Steam is a massive fog cloud, there are important sites that cut through the dense mists and is well occupied for such a dangerous plane. 

### Adrift

This city was created by outsiders to the realm and is in the shape of a spinning ring with clouds gathered around the outside. While there are the perpetual mists of this plane in the city, it is not so thick that travelers have to worry about drowning on it. At the center of the city’s ring are the Floating Statues, massive sculptures of human men and women that are over 1,000 feet in length. While no one is quite sure who these statues depict, they are quite old and many are beginning to fall apart, though their broken pieces still float next to the statue they broke off from. Creatures of all types live and work next to the mephits of this plane, creating a safe place for travelers to visit.

### The Tower of [[Places/Cosmology/Planes of Existance/Inner Planes/Para Elemental Planes/Plane of Ice|Plane of Ice]]

Piercing through the borders of the Positive Energy Plane and Steam, this massive tower is made entirely of [[Places/Cosmology/Planes of Existance/Inner Planes/Para Elemental Planes/Plane of Ice|Plane of Ice]]. While it is difficult to enter the structure, a secret not often passed on to strangers, alchemists and poisoners find that the arcane laboratories within create potions and poisons of exceptional quality. Control over the tower is tenuous and those who work within the labs rarely stay for long to cement their rule over the tower.
