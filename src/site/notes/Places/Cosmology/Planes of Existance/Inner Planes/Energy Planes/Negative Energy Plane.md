# Negative Energy Plane
### Negative Energy Plane: An Outsider’s Perspective
Travelers are first greeted with a night so black that many might swear they had been struck blind, but even that darkness can’t compare to the Negative Energy Plane. It is often described as a darkness so pure that it is like standing on a barren world in the pitch blackness of night with no stars or moons shining, while you have your eyes closed, a thousand miles beneath the ground, and in a _darkness_ spell. This void isn’t empty though, for there is a greedy nature of the plane that sucks out all life of anything and everything. Heat and life are drawn out, matter decays, and energy is removed. 

This plane is known for its non-stop hunger for everything. It is a dark and empty plane, uncaring and intolerant of all life. It truly is the most hostile of all the planes, though that doesn’t mean everything within it is destroyed. Undeath and those who seek it claim home within its darkness.

### Negative Energy Plane: A Native’s Perspective
This plane is relatively empty and devoid of anything that might resemble life or being. While the plane is considered to be part of the Inner Planes, it is not a true elemental plane, meaning that it doesn’t even create elementals aligned with itself. Outsiders that survive this plane are few and only found in specific locations, clinging to life, or unlife as it happens to be. Unlike the Positive Energy Plane, this plane does have a thriving population of undead. 

While many might believe that all undeath comes from the [[Places/Cosmology/Planes of Existance/Reflection Planes/Shadowfell|Shadowfell]], even the [[Places/Cosmology/Planes of Existance/Reflection Planes/Shadowfell|Shadowfell]] gains much of its power over undeath from the Negative Energy Plane. Not every type of undead can be found on this plane though as even they find it difficult to live out their death here. Those undead who suck the essence from other creatures finds a welcoming respite on this plane, wraiths, specters, wights, vampires, and liches make their home on the sucking and ever-hungry plane of negative energy. 

The only creature that can be thought to be a true native of this plane is the xeg-yi, a sentient form of energy of an alien mind and body. No one is sure where, or what they truly are, but they go about this plane as if on some task known only to them.

## Traits
### Negative Energy Plane: Atmosphere
Devoid of life and energy, this plane drains 2d6 hit points per minute spent on the plane. If this reduces a creature to 0 hit points, they immediately die, their soul consumed by the plane - which is impossible to ever restore even with the most powerful magic or by the intervention of a god - and their body is animated into a form of undeath. To survive this process, a creature must gain access to a _negative energy protection_ spell before arriving on this plane or the spell has no effect as its energy is immediately drained from it by the plane.

Pure black is all that can be seen on this plane with any light immediately extinguished by the plane, no matter how powerful the spell. Any damage spell that is cast on this plane does its maximum amount of damage, while any healing spell is reduced to the least amount that it can heal. This plane hates any form of life or energy, be it a living creature or object. Any objects on a creature stay formed while the creature lives, but as soon as it is let go or the creature dies, the objects fall apart and disintegrate as if subjected to aging from eons of years unattended. Even powerful magical artifacts will eventually succumb to this plane’s death.

## Doldrums - Negative Energy Plane
In rare regions across the Negative Energy Plane are points where life can find a way. These areas are, for whatever reason, less infused with death and the draining of all life and so these areas are relatively safe such that structures and cities can be built at their locations and settlements can grow. While these places might seem like bright spots of life in an otherwise deadly plane, they are constantly overrun with the undead that gravitates towards these spots, hoping to feed on anyone they can devour. Many settlements that have been created here are now just cities of the undead with hordes of zombies roaming their streets in search of life to devour.

## Negative Energy Plane: Locations
A realm of death and its ever-hunger for the consumption of life force, locations in this plane are focused on the exploration of death - or are completely overrun by the undead. Despite the deadliness of this plane, there are still a few locations that have somehow survived against the draining influence of this realm.

### Death Heart
This spired city is located in one of the largest doldrums in the plane and is constructed on the inside of a hollow metal sphere about a mile in diameter. Inside the sphere, the normal extremes of the plane are almost completely free of the negative energy of the plane, allowing the dimmest of lights to illuminate the city. While the negative energy couldn’t penetrate past the shell, the city’s original inhabitants couldn’t survive the plane. 

It was supposed to be a school of thinking and free ideas, though the life of this city quickly attracted the undead of this plane who eagerly attacked in massive waves. Eventually, the city would succumb to the plague of undead, the flesh and souls of its inhabitants devoured by the plane. All that remains of the city are the undead who choke its streets and spill out from the buildings as factions of undeath begin to spring up. Vampire lords war against liches who war against ghouls and ghasts - fighting to secure control over the city.

Many believe that a vampire is well on their way to winning the struggle, and will eventually turn their sights on how the sphere works and how they might transition it to another plane to unleash their undead armies against its inhabitants.

### Fortress of the Soul
Through great difficulty, the faction known as the Dustmen keep up a citadel functioning in this plane. They are even helpful to outsiders seeking shelter from the deadliness of the plane, though they don’t allow long term visitors - instead, they send the creatures through a portal to their Mortuary on [[Places/Cosmology/Planes of Existance/Outer Planes/Outlands/Sigil|Sigil]] that functions once a week. For the Dustmen, this plane and citadel are a holy site and represent their idea of the True Death. They see the ending energies of the Negative Energy Plane as the answer to their existence in the afterlife and the key to move on to the next worlds, hoping to truly enter their version of the afterlife in a True Death.

Those that can reach this citadel find the Dustmen and the undead existing side-by-side as the Dustmen have some natural control over the undead. The citadel is largely used to be a place of quiet meditation and the Dustmen don’t take kindly to adventurers and travelers using their citadel as a tourist destination.
