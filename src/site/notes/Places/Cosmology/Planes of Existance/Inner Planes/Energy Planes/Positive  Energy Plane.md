# Positive  Energy Plane
### Positive  Energy Plane: An Outsider’s Perspective
Many travelers don’t expect a plane of life and positive energy to be inherently hostile, but it is because this plane is so full of energy and limitless life that it is so. When a traveler visits this plane, they quickly begin filling up with such brilliant energy that they are blinded by the [[Places/Cosmology/Planes of Existance/Inner Planes/Positive Quasi-Elemental Planes/Plane of Radiance|Plane of Radiance]] of the plane. Their body begins filling up on life, healing any cuts, wounds, scars, or other anathemas to life until their body is so full of positive energy that they simply explode out, their body and possessions becoming part of the plane and its radiant energy.

This plane can’t help but exude life and churning energy, overbrimming with [[Places/Cosmology/Planes of Existance/Inner Planes/Positive Quasi-Elemental Planes/Plane of Radiance|Plane of Radiance]], it causes all visitors to flood with such powerful energy that their mortal body is unable to hold it all within until they finally succumb to the pure life of this plane. Only a few creatures can truly claim this plane as their home, even though hundreds of gods claim control over life and healing.

### Positive  Energy Plane: A Native’s Perspective
This plane is so full of life and boundless energy of creation that no creature can live here but for a select few. Mortals who travel this plane unprepared explode with life, literally, and their body torn about by the brilliant light of this realm. As black and dark as the [[Places/Cosmology/Planes of Existance/Inner Planes/Energy Planes/Negative Energy Plane|Negative Energy Plane]], the Positive Energy Plane is just as bright if not brighter - though anywho gaze more than a few seconds into this plane find themselves permanently blind. To gaze upon the energy of creation is too much for even the gods who travel to this plane. 

There are a few outposts on this plane, though they take special precautions and have poured vast wealth into maintaining their fortresses on this plane. The inhabitants are mortals who are studying life and cures to draining afflictions that would end life and energy. It’s said that a hospital of sorts has been set up in a portion of this plane where paladins bring in the most grievously injured and cursed, that the plane might cure them of their ails and restore them back to peak life.

Much like the [[Places/Cosmology/Planes of Existance/Inner Planes/Energy Planes/Negative Energy Plane|Negative Energy Plane]], this plane holds a mysterious and alien creature known as xag-ya, a sentient being of energy. While no one truly knows anything about these creatures, they know enough to give them a wide berth. These creatures, probably with no ill intent, can simply cause a creature to explode in energy and life, their forms so attuned to this realm that waves of energy roll off of them.

## Traits
### Positive  Energy Plane: Atmosphere
Bursting with energy and life, this plane grants 2d6 hit points per minute spent on the plane. These special hit points first heal any missing hit points and then beginning increasing a creature’s maximum hit points, if this total ever exceeds double their normal hit point maximum, they explode in an orb of light as their body can no longer handle the excessive amount of energy in them. If they leave for another plane with this increased hit points, they slowly fade over 2d10 days or if the creature takes damage. Some warriors, sages, and paladins have been known to take advantage of this plane before going into battle, though they don’t always survive such a dangerous endeavor. To survive this process, a creature must gain access to a positive energy protection spell before arriving on this plane or the spell has no effect as its energy is immediately pulled into the plane. A creature under the effects of the spell do not gain any additional hit points or can benefit from the healing energy of this plane.

Pure, brilliant white light is all that can be seen around a creature. Unless a thick blindfold is pressed tightly against the eyes, a creature will go blind from the [[Places/Cosmology/Planes of Existance/Inner Planes/Positive Quasi-Elemental Planes/Plane of Radiance|Plane of Radiance]], even through squeezed shut eyelids. With a thick blindfold, darkened forms against a brilliant white light can be seen for there is no true darkness on this plane. No darkness, even if cast by powerful magic, can survive. This plane infuses everything with energy, be it a living creature or object. Any objects on a creature stay formed while the creature lives, but as soon as it is let go or the creature dies, the objects overload and disintegrate into pure energy. Even powerful magical artifacts will eventually succumb to this burning [[Places/Cosmology/Planes of Existance/Inner Planes/Positive Quasi-Elemental Planes/Plane of Radiance|Plane of Radiance]].

## Edge Zones - Positive Energy Plane
Quiet spots throughout the plane like islands dotting a sea of [[Places/Cosmology/Planes of Existance/Inner Planes/Para Elemental Planes/Plane of Magma|Plane of Magma]]. These regions are the only safe locations in the Positive Energy Plane where citadels and settlements can spring up for creatures powerful enough to stand against the very nature of this plane. It’s a constant struggle to keep such places intact as waves of positive energy can wash over them constantly, threatening to drag these quiet spots into the boiling mass of raw life and boundless energy.

## Positive  Energy Plane: Locations
Energy and life flood through this plane, creating and churning in the brilliant white light of creation. This plane is responsible for all life in the multiverse, the gods channel this divine wellspring of life and breathing it into their creations. Despite the burning energy of this plane, there are a few locations that can survive against the burning energy of this realm. 

### Fortress of Life
Feadal Didam-Hurus is responsible for this location in the Positive Energy Plane, somehow she pushed back the life of this plane and created a place of study for her and several ravid who have decided to help her. She is studying the limitless energies of the plane and is safeguarding a valuable orb of life known as Lifepearls. These concentrated orbs of the plane are thought to be the seeds of creation and they form in sporadic locations across the plane. 

Feadal has made it her life mission to travel the plane in search of these strange pearls, bring them back to her fortress, and safeguard them from those who would try to abuse the power of these pearls as they are incredibly potent at healing magic. Along with her are the ravid who seem to hold the lifepearls with equal measure, helping to keep outsiders from accessing the vault and assisting in her studies.

### Hospice
Hospice is a floating citadel protected from the hostile energies of the plane by thick rocks that act as a shield for all those inside the citadel. Paladins, holy knights, clerics, and healers who have dedicated themselves to the healing arts make their home in this citadel, studying the healing energies of life as well as taking care of the badly wounded. They see a wide variety of individuals, not just those who have been in fights, but those with incurable ailments, horrible curses, and more - they work diligently to restore them to health and to unlock the secrets of healing and life. 

Because the order of healers is worried about attracting the wrong attention from necromancers and others, the location of Hospice as well as how to get to this citadel is carefully safeguarded. While Hospice has no problem with healing evil creatures, they go to great lengths to try to rehabilitate them and keep them secured in the citadel during their visits.
