# Spelljammer Academy
# Part 1
## Overview
This adventure takes approximately two hours to play and is split into three parts:

[[The Story/2022-12-06#Part 1: Welcome to Wildspace|Part 1: Welcome to Wildspace!]] The recruits undertake a quick combat trial on the Simulations Deck, so that academy personnel can assess their skills.

[[The Story/2022-12-06#Part 2: Academy Orientation|Part 2: Academy Orientation]] After the simulation, the new cadets receive a crash course on the academy's purpose and general layout, as they complete a laundry list of tasks to acclimate to their new home.

[[The Story/2022-12-06#Part 3: Intruder Alert!|Part 3: Intruder Alert!]] The cadets deliver a crate of supplies to Mirt the Merciless, the head of the academy, but discover that their cargo contains a deadly surprise.

# Part 1: Welcome to Wildspace

Spelljammer Academy's newest recruits are brought to the Simulations Deck for a quick combat trial so that academy personnel can assess their skills and readiness. The magic of the Simulations Deck puts a unique spin on the training session, dropping player characters straight into the action.

## Right into the Action

When everyone is ready to begin, roll for initiative. Then read or paraphrase the following aloud:

>[!warning] **EXPLOSION!!!**
ihr steht auf dem Deck eures Raumschiffs "Mondstrahl", selbst als Explosionen zwei seiner Masten vernichten und ein Dutzend eurer Schiffskameraden in den Weltraum schleudern! Entfernte Sterne und sich drehende Wolken aus vielfarbigem Gas wirbeln um euch ume, als die erste Piratengaleone in die Steuerbordseite der Mondstrahl kracht, und ein stinkender Windstoß fegt über euch hinweg, als die Lufthülle der Galeone mit eurer eigenen verschmilzt. Sekunden später wird eues Schiff von astralen Jägern geentert - Humanoiden mit seltsamen Gesichtszügen, wo mit grausamen Waffen herumfuchteln und Zaubersprüche entfesseln.  
>
Kapitän Sardax liegt auf dem Deck in der Nähe, ihr Körper ist von Schrapnellen zerfetzt. "Haltet das Oberdeck!", knurrt sie mit ihrem letzten Atemzug. " Gebt ihnen kein Pardon!"  

This encounter starts in the thick of the action. The characters are in the midst of a magical illusion used to train Spelljammer Academy cadets. The shock of being plunged into the illusory simulation has left them disoriented and unable to sense that what they see is only in their minds. Both the characters and the players should believe that the simulation is real. When your players ask the inevitable questions about how they got here, use the following to guide your answers:

-   The characters know that they are crew members on _Moonraider_, but they have no recollection of events prior to the reavers' attack.
-   The characters are new members of the crew, making their first journey into Wildspace.
-   At a guess, it seems likely that the reavers have used some kind of magic to disorient _Moonraider_'s crew, hoping to make it easier to seize the ship.
-   The characters know Captain Sardax and understand that her death leaves it up to them and the other surviving crew members to repel the reavers.
-   The characters know and trust each other. _Moonraider_ is their ship, and they are bound to defend it!

"Forecastle Map" shows the layout of the area that the characters are defending. They are the only sailors still alive in this section of the ship.

Forecastle Map

## Fighting the Reavers

At the start of combat, place two astral reavers (Pirate First mate + Bandit captain) at the edge of the forecastle area. Don't roll initiative for these enemies. Instead, all reavers act at the end of the initiative order, after the characters have taken their turns. More reavers then appear during the round (see below).

At the start of each character's turn, roll on the Battle Events table to determine a random event, which can include the appearance of new reavers. As each new enemy appears, roll on the Astral Reavers table to determine a special quality for them, and use these descriptions to help identify specific reavers in combat.

When you've played two full rounds of combat, proceed to the "[[The Story/2022-12-06#End Simulation|End Simulation]]" section below.

Battle Events

| d20   | Event                                                                                                                                                                                                     |
| ----- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| 1-12  | A new astral reaver ([Pirate first Mate](https://5e.tools/bestiary.html#pirate%20first%20mate_gos)) jumps into an unoccupied space within 30 feet of the character.                                                                  |
| 13    | An explosion rocks the ship. Each creature on the deck must succeed on a DC 10 Dexterity saving throw or fall [prone](https://5e.tools/conditionsdiseases.html#prone_phb).                                |
| 14    | A second spelljamming ship soars overhead, raining arrows down on the defenders. Each character must roll a d20. On a roll of 1–9, they are targeted by an arrow (+3 to hit, 3 piercing damage on a hit). |
| 15    | An untended coil of rope slams into the character, unfurling and reducing their speed by half until the end of their turn.                                                                                | 
| 16    | Loose rigging careens across the deck. Choose a character. That character must succeed on a DC 10 Dexterity (Acrobatics) check to grab the rigging and be safely flung to an unoccupied space within 40 feet of their current position. On a failure, they stay where they are and fall [prone](https://5e.tools/conditionsdiseases.html#prone_phb).                                                                                                                                                                                                          |
| 17    | The ship's dog, Bruno, rushes to the aid of a character of the player's choosing. The character can use a reaction to sip once from the healing keg around Bruno's neck (no action required), regaining 1d6 hit points.                                                                                                                                                                                                          |
| 18-20 | An allied sailor on the main deck fires an arrow at a reaver (+4 to hit, 8 piercing damage on a hit).                                                                                                                                                                                                          |

### Astral Reavers

The reavers are coal-hearted miscreants united only by the urge to raid and pillage. Each reaver has the statistics of a[Pirate first Mate](https://5e.tools/bestiary.html#pirate%20first%20mate_gos) but has a unique appearance determined by the Astral Reavers table.

Astral Reavers

| d12 | Appearance                                                                                              |
| --- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |

| 2   | Giant goldfish-bowl head containing a floating brain                                                    |
| 3   | Four arms, two of which are used solely to perform threatening or insulting gestures                    |
| 4   | Iridescent scales and glowing pink eyes                                                                 |
| 5   | Enormous nose and ears                                                                                  |
| 6   | Helicopter blades mounted on head (flying speed of 10 feet, with a maximum hovering altitude of 3 feet) |
| 7   | Infantile second head that continually spits curses                                                     |
| 8   | Burning beard, and breath that reeks of booze                                                           | 
| 9   | Wears a torn wedding dress stained in blood                                                                                                         |
| 10  | Blue-skinned, with a single large horn on forehead                                                                                                        |
| 11  | Fishlike features and needlelike teeth                                                                                                        |
| 12  | Reflective skin                                                                                                        |


## End Simulation

After two full rounds of combat have been resolved, end the combat by reading or paraphrasing the following:

A thunderous explosion shakes the ship, filling the air with splinters of wood. Bodies are hurled into Wildspace—and then everything stops. Wreckage hangs motionless. Reavers freeze in the middle of their attacks. Even the stars stop twinkling.

The illusion of Wildspace melts away, and you find yourselves in one of the magical chambers of the Simulations Deck, your memories slowly fitting back into place. You recall being warned that your first experience of a Wildspace simulation would be disorienting—to test your ability to function under pressure.

A hulking figure emerges from the center of the explosion: a hadozee with a missing wing flap wearing a military uniform bristling with medals. The air around her smells like cigar smoke. "As you can see," Boatswain Tarto growls, "the battle of H'Catha didn't go so well for Captain Sardax and her crew. But her last battle makes a good testing ground for new recruits. End simulation!"

The characters remember meeting the hadozee training officer Boatswain Tarto (see the sidebar), and that the battle has been an illusory exercise conducted in one of the academy's simulation chambers—large circular spaces whose rune-scribed walls channel potent magical power, and which contain training versions of _spelljamming helms_ (akin to those used to propel real spelljamming ships). As the simulation ends, all characters regain any lost hit points, spell slots, or limited-use powers. Characters who died during the encounter discover that they were merely [unconscious](https://5e.tools/conditionsdiseases.html#unconscious_phb), and each gains one level of [exhaustion](https://5e.tools/conditionsdiseases.html#exhaustion_phb) from lingering psychic shock.

With the training exercise complete, the new recruits are ready for debriefing and orientation. Proceed to "Part 2: Academy Orientation."

[![](https://5e.tools/img/adventure/SjA/002-01-002.o-boatswain-tarto.webp)](https://5e.tools/img/adventure/SjA/002-01-002.o-boatswain-tarto.webp)



Boatswain Tarto (Spelljammer Corps Training Officer)

_Hadozee Seasoned Boatswain_

The scars that Boatswain Tarto (pronounced BOE-sun TAR-toe) bears are testament to her status as a battle-hardened veteran. Despite having one of her wing flaps torn away long ago, she remains as capable as ever while on board a ship. Spelljammer Academy has no better person to spearhead the training of raw recruits—and Tarto knows it. Never one to mince words (even when those words are directed toward those who outrank her), this old, grizzled hadozee has light-tan skin and ebon-black fur graying at the temples. She's perpetually shrouded in a thick haze of cigar smoke, the smell of which often signals her imminent arrival.

**Quote**: "Listen to what I tell you; it might just save your life."

# Part 2: Academy Orientation

Spelljammer Academy's newest cadets are given an extensive orientation. With an assigned list of orientation tasks at hand, the characters have a chance to visit various areas of the academy, noting which areas are off-limits to stripling cadets—and the dire punishments that can be meted out on those who stray into unauthorized territory.

## Debriefing

When you're ready to start, read or paraphrase the following:

You arrived this morning on _Belligerence_, a chartered galley out of Waterdeep, which picked up passengers and crew in the Moonshae Isles, Baldur's Gate, Candlekeep, and Port Nyanzaru. You've come to seek fortune and glory at Spelljammer Academy: a secret enclave of spellcasters and swords-for-hire on the mysterious isle of Nimbral. Graduates from the academy join the Spelljammer Fleet, a magical navy sworn to protect Toril and explore worlds far beyond.

The academy is carved into a two-thousand-foot-high column of rock that juts up from the cliffs of the island's west coast, its multiple levels connected by stairs, ramps, and magical lifts. After docking in a sea cave at the base of the column, you marched to the Simulations Deck midway up the academy spire. Your mettle has been tested, and now it's time to settle in!

Give the players a copy of handout 1, "[Spelljammer Academy Map](https://5e.tools/adventure.html#sja,0,handout%201%3a%20spelljammer%20academy%20map,0)."

During the characters' debriefing, Boatswain Tarto gives each of them a pitiless assessment of their performance during the trial. As training officer, it's her job to whip new recruits into shape and show that everybody has room for improvement. Be appropriate and mindful of your players, however. A truly good leader isn't needlessly rude or cruel in their criticisms.

After the debriefing, Boatswain Tarto explains the history and mission of Spelljammer Academy (see the accompanying sidebar). Any character with spellcasting talent qualifies to join the Spelljammers, the contingent of those able to pilot a spelljamming ship. Everyone else must join the ranks of the Spelljammer Corps.

Tarto informs the cadets that they must complete several orientation tasks before the day is out (see "Orientation Tasks" below). The tasks can be completed in any order.

Spelljammer Academy

While adventurers of all stripes explore Faerûn and deal with the perils of ancient ruins, malevolent cults, and long-forgotten tombs, those who come through Spelljammer Academy on Nimbral strive to protect the world from far greater threats. Spelljammer Academy trains cadets for service as Spelljammers and members of the Spelljammer Corps: both branches of a magical navy sworn to protect Toril and to explore other worlds beyond. Few people know of the academy's existence, and its leaders try to keep it that way.

Mirt the Merciless—also known as "the Old Wolf"—is Spelljammer Academy's founder and chief financial officer. He manages the institution's operations alongside a small group of powerful high-ranking officers, known collectively as "the Bridge." While most of its candidates are from Toril, the academy occasionally recruits from outside Realmspace (the Wildspace system that is home to the planet Toril) to bring individuals with unique talents into their ranks. Giff, githyanki, hadozee, plasmoids, and myriad other peoples can join the cadets alongside folk native to Toril.

The academy was founded by Mirt as part of a joint investment with the retired elf adventurer Elmandar, who operates a shop on the Rock of Bral—a city built on an asteroid. Prince Andru, the monarch of Bral, has invested heavily in the academy, though his support has waned of late over questions regarding security within the institution.

### Orientation Tasks
The characters' orientation tasks appear on handout 2 for the players:

#### Orientation Tasks
ALL CADETS: COLLECT WELCOME PACK FROM ADMINISTRATION

ALL CADETS: REPORT TO QUARTERS FOR BUNK ASSIGNMENT

ALL CADETS: REPORT TO SKY DOCK FOR SPELLJAMMING SHIP INSPECTION

CORP CADETS ONLY: COLLECT SERVICE WEAPONRY FROM MISTER BLIP IN STORES

SPELLJAMMER CADETS ONLY: REPORT TO SPELLJAMMER NEXUS FOR BASIC TRAINING

ALL CADETS: COMPLETE GYMNASIUM ASSAULT COURSE

The task list also features a note regarding security, which the characters see posted throughout the academy:

#### Warning!
Due to recent thefts, security checkpoints are in operation throughout campus. Failure to stop when challenged will result in disintegration!

[[The Story/Running Notes|Running Notes]]
If asked about the thefts, Tarto reveals that several navigational charts depicting Realmspace were stolen recently from the Spelljammer Nexus, the training area for Spelljammer cadets. The thefts have shaken the confidence of the academy's investors and caused them to reduce their monthly funding. Mirt is not happy!

Boatswain Tarto tells the characters to get on with their tasks, then report back to her once all those tasks are complete. Tarto remains on the Simulations Deck.

## Exploring the Academy

The characters are now free to explore the campus. See "[Academy Locations](https://5e.tools/adventure.html#sja,0,academy%20locations,0)" below for information on each area noted in the orientation tasks.

### Security Levels

Spelljammer Academy has a five-tier security system. Each tier is represented by a different color, as shown below on the Security Levels table. Security levels increase from green to gold, and each higher level has access to all areas accessible to lower security levels.

Academy personnel wear uniforms in the color of their security access level. The characters are inducted as cadets (level 2) and must visit administration to collect their uniforms. To access higher security levels, academy cadets and personnel must request a security helmet: a rigid leather cap dyed in the appropriate color.

Security checkpoints are set up throughout the academy, each guarded by three [veterans](https://5e.tools/bestiary.html#veteran_mm). Each guard carries a shortsword that has a green-glowing blade. Any creature reduced to 0 hit points by one of these blades is instantly turned to dust, as if affected by a [disintegrate](https://5e.tools/spells.html#disintegrate_phb) spell. Such a sword loses its magical properties if removed from Spelljammer Academy.

Security guards refuse access to anyone not wearing the appropriate attire.

### Academy Events

As the characters explore the academy, you can roll on the Academy Events table at any point to help you bring the campus to life.

Academy Events

| d8  | Event |
| --- | ----- |
| 1   |  A halfling cadet dashes past, clearly late for training. Turning a corner, they bump into a pair of plasmoid cadets—and become partially stuck in one of them! After pulling themself out and helping the plasmoid correct their uniform, the halfling runs on, shouting an apology.     |
| 2   | Two cadets face off in a game that magically projects illusory spelljamming ships above the game board.      |
| 3   | A visiting giff dignitary is inspecting the campus, escorted by academy officers. When the giff loudly breaks wind, the officers politely carry on as though nobody heard it.      |
| 4   | A magical voice announces: "All purple rank security officers report to the Sky Dock for docking inspection."      |
| 5   | A manacled [mind flayer](https://5e.tools/bestiary.html#mind%20flayer_mm) passes by on a gurney pushed by fleet officers. The mind flayer wears an iron mask with bands restraining its facial tentacles.      |
| 6   | Strange glowing fish swim through the air, phasing through walls as they go. Nobody appears bothered by them.      |
| 7   | A magical voice announces: "Ectoplasmic breach on Spelljammer Nexus level. All personnel, be prepared for supernatural anomalies."      |
| 8   |  Two sailors walk past, discussing how even in spite of recent improvements, three out of ten exploratory fleet missions still result in all hands lost.     |

## Academy Locations
The following descriptions are keyed to locations noted on the Spelljammer Academy map.

### Administration
_Security Level: Green (Visitor Rank) or Above, Purple (Officer Rank) or Above for the Record Room_

Administration occupies the level above the [Sea Dock](https://5e.tools/adventure.html#sja,0,sea%20dock,0). It includes a visitors' lounge with a bar, guest rooms for visiting off-world dignitaries, and the academy reception. A record room requires purple-level security to enter and contains paperwork on all academy personnel.

Orientation Task: Welcome Pack. 

Characters can visit reception to collect their cadet-issue welcome packs from a thri-kreen named Sor'kur. Each pack includes the following gear:

-   A red-level cadet uniform (plus spare), and a toiletry bag
-   A 50 gp requisition voucher to spend at the academy stores
-   A blue-level security helmet for visiting the Sky Dock during orientation

As the equipment is issued, staff members at reception give the new cadets a rundown on the academy's security protocols (see "[Exploring the Academy](https://5e.tools/adventure.html#sja,0,exploring%20the%20academy,0)" above).



Sor'kur
_Thri-kreen Receptionist_

The thri-kreen receptionist Sor'kur (pronounced SOAR-ker) is always busy, and there's no one better suited for the job. Whether she's sorting mail, passing messages, asking requests for assistance via several [sending stones](https://5e.tools/items.html#sending%20stones_dmg), or handing out welcome packs to new recruits, her multiple arms make it all look easy. Sor'kur has white chitin mottled with patches of brilliant blue, and matching blue eyes.

**Quote**: "Academy accounts payable, Sor'kur speaking, please hold."

### Bridge Quarters
_Security Level: Gold (Bridge Rank) Only_

These opulent chambers are home to the Bridge—the high-ranking officers who run Spelljammer Academy. In addition to the officers' quarters, this level contains a private banqueting chamber, a library of spellbooks, and a magical communication chamber known as an oracularium. Characters visit the Bridge Quarters in [part 3](https://5e.tools/adventure.html#sja,0,part%203%3a%20intruder%20alert!,0) of this adventure.

### Cadet Quarters
_Security Level: Red (Cadet Rank) or Above_

This area contains a dormitory for cadets and a smaller dorm for academy graduates, the Weeping Goddess tavern (a raucous bar that serves cadets), a refectory where cadets take their meals (complete with patio dining), washrooms, the academy kitchens, and the laundry.

Orientation Task: Bunk Assignment. 

On the characters' arrival, a giff duty officer assigns a bunk to each cadet and tells them to store their gear in their footlocker. As the characters claim their bunks, one character of your choice discovers that they've been assigned an airy bunk next to a window, near the laundry. As that character walks over to drop off their gear, four cadets march toward them. One of those cadets—a confident-looking moon elf—hurls her kit bag onto the bunk before the character can get there.

"Change of plan, greenie. This bunk's mine now. Go tell the duty officer it wasn't to your liking, and we'll get ourselves swapped over. Tell him you've traded bunks with Veena."

The elf points to an unkempt bunk in the noisiest section of the dorm, just outside the washrooms.

Veena is testing the new cadets. A character who succeeds on a DC 15 Charisma (Intimidation) check can scare her and her friends away. Otherwise, the arrogant cadets are more than willing to use force to teach the upstart characters who's boss. Give [inspiration](https://5e.tools/book.html#PHB,4,inspiration,0) to any character who overcomes the situation without resorting to violence.

Veena and the other cadets use the[Pirate first Mate](https://5e.tools/bestiary.html#pirate%20first%20mate_gos) stat block but carry no weapons. Instead, they make unarmed attacks (+3 to hit, 2 bludgeoning damage on a hit). Anyone reduced to 0 hit points by such attacks is knocked [unconscious](https://5e.tools/conditionsdiseases.html#unconscious_phb) for 5 minutes but doesn't make death saving throws. Veena and her friends flee if they take 2 or more damage in total.

### Gymnasium
_Security Level: Red (Cadet Rank) or Above_
The Gymnasium features a magically powered arena that can be reconfigured for a variety of training exercises. For the induction of new recruits, it is set up for a standard cadet training course.

Orientation Task: Obstacle Course. 

Each cadet must complete the obstacle course by making ability checks or saving throws to overcome the following obstacles in order:

-   Make a straight dash while targeted by loud illusory explosions, requiring a successful DC 12 Constitution saving throw.
-   Leap across levitating platforms over pools of electrified water, requiring a successful DC 12 Strength (Athletics) or Dexterity (Acrobatics) check.
-   Swing from ropes through a spinning wheel of maces, requiring a successful DC 14 Dexterity saving throw.
-   Climb a slippery pole and ring a gong at the top, requiring a successful DC 14 Strength (Athletics) check.

Roll initiative to determine the order of play. In each stage in the course, a character must succeed on the indicated ability check or saving throw to overcome the obstacle and move on. A character who fails remains where they are and can try again next turn. If they fail by 5 or more, they also take 10 damage of a type you choose, consistent with the test—lightning damage for the water pools, thunder damage for the explosions, and so forth.

Any character reduced to 0 hit points during the obstacle course falls [unconscious](https://5e.tools/conditionsdiseases.html#unconscious_phb) and must sit out the remainder of the event. Give inspiration to any character who successfully completes the course.

### Sea Dock
_Security Level: Green (Visitor Rank) or Above, Blue (Sailor Rank) or Above for the Cargo Area_

This expansive sea cave contains berths for oceangoing vessels, animal pens for livestock, a dry dock for ship repairs, and a blue-level restricted area for cargo storage. New recruits arriving at the Sea Dock are guided to reception on the [Administration](https://5e.tools/adventure.html#sja,0,administration,0) level.

### Simulations Deck
_Security Level: Green (Visitor Rank) or Above, Purple (Officer Rank) or Above for the Officers' Mess_

The Simulations Deck features a circular main hall leading to three magical simulation chambers. Each simulation chamber is a large circular space with a domed ceiling and arcane runes carved into its stonework. Using preset command words, an officer in uniform can create a variety of simulations within any one of these chambers, filling it with an illusory scene that affects the five senses.

Boatswain Tarto is present here throughout the day as the characters attempt to complete their orientation tasks, running other cadets through a variety of training programs. Characters can report back to her after completing their orientation tasks (see "[Reporting to Tarto](https://5e.tools/adventure.html#sja,0,reporting%20to%20tarto,0)" below).

An officer's mess on this level requires purple-level security or higher to enter. The mess is where instructors and other officers of the academy have their meals.

### Sky Dock
_Security Level: Blue (Sailor Rank) and Above_

Spelljamming ships frequently dock at the summit of the academy. Most vessels are assigned to the Spelljammer Academy, but some are independent merchant vessels delivering supplies.

Security guards at the stairs leading to the Sky Dock challenge anyone trying to enter this area without proper authorization (see "[Exploring the Academy](https://5e.tools/adventure.html#sja,0,exploring%20the%20academy,0)"). The characters must be wearing the blue security helmets included in their welcome packs (see "[Administration](https://5e.tools/adventure.html#sja,0,administration,0)") to access this area.

Orientation Task: Ship Inspection. 

Twin gnome officers named Kip and Pik show the characters around a spelljamming ship, teaching them the basic operations of the vessel and explaining how equipment should be handled.

One Good Turn. 

At some point during the inspection, have each character make a Wisdom (Perception) check. Whoever rolls the highest notices a suspicious event. On a nearby dock, a hobgoblin academy officer supervising the unloading of a merchant ship surreptitiously slips the merchant a platinum piece. In return, the merchant hands the hobgoblin a small bottle, which the officer conceals in his pocket. It is up to the characters to act on this information or ignore it.

If the characters report the officer (who you can name as you wish), the hobgoblin is challenged and gives up the bottle, which holds fine Yggdrasil Garden Rum. The officer is consigned to the brig for violation of customs charges—but the characters later learn that he is beloved among the graduate sailors. A sniff of rum is the officer's off-the-books reward for each sailor who returns alive from a mission into Wildspace. In bringing the officer into disrepute, the characters have surely earned some enemies! Have the players note this outcome for future adventures.



Kip and Pik Whistleslap

_Gnome Inspectors_

When nit-picking inane details, four eyes are better than two—something that Kip and Pik Whistleslap make abundantly clear. The two gnome ship inspectors wear meticulously maintained uniforms and the most-feared white gloves in the academy. Both have walnut-colored skin and carefully groomed long black hair, kept in tidy buns. Kip is well known for his no-nonsense attitude, which is complemented by his sister Pik's quick-witted jovialness. Pik has a red scar down one cheek—a stern reminder of an inspection gone wrong.

-   Quirk. Kip and Pik often finish one another's sentences, a trait that others sometimes find unnerving.

### Spelljammer Nexus
_Security Level: Red (Cadet Rank) and Above_

The Spelljammer Nexus is the exclusive training area for Spelljammer cadets. It contains a laboratory, a library of navigational and astronautical references, a chart room, and the nexus itself, which is a large chamber containing eight training _spelljamming helms_—ornate, high-backed chairs mounted onto mechanical gimbals that encircle a thirty-foot-high orrery depicting Realmspace.

Those who train here are overseen by Saerthe Abizjn, a training officer (see the accompanying sidebar). Only Spelljammer cadets are permitted entry to the nexus, though Spelljammer Corps cadets can observe their training from the viewing gallery.

[![](https://5e.tools/img/adventure/SjA/006-01-004.o-sarthe-abizjn.webp)](https://5e.tools/img/adventure/SjA/006-01-004.o-sarthe-abizjn.webp)



Saerthe Abizjn (Spelljammer Training Officer)
_Human Spelljammer_

Despite their extravagant showboating, Saerthe Abizjn (pronounced SAIR-th ah-bih-ZEEN) remains as mysterious as the isle of Nimbral from which they hail. Although relatively inexperienced in comparison to some of the other instructors at the academy, Saerthe is an experienced spelljammer. Their eyes shimmer like pools of quicksilver, allowing them to see magical auras.

Saerthe's quick wit and sharp tongue provide them with an inexhaustible supply of jabs and quips (though never mean-spirited), accompanied to great effect by their natural talent with illusory magic. Saerthe's white skin is so pale as to be almost translucent, and their blonde hair is worn in a fashionable, immaculately manicured pompadour.

**Quote**: "I make talent look good."

Orientation Task: Basic Training. 

Saerthe teaches Spelljammer cadets how to operate the training helms and guide the movement of miniature test ships, which move mechanically through the orrery as it spins. To complete their training, each Spelljammer cadet must use their helm to complete a Realmspace journey with their test vessel.

Issuing commands through a _spelljamming helm_ is a strange sensation: more akin to thinking about moving a limb than operating controls. No ability checks are required here, but Saerthe asks each character involved in a training session one of the following questions:

- "Welches Ereignis in deiner Vergangenheit hat dich dazu gebracht, jetzt in diesem Moment zu leben?"  
- "Irgendetwas in deinem Kopf hält dich zurück. Was ist es? Sprich, oder es könnte deine Fähigkeit zu fliegen vergiften."  
- "Sag mir ehrlich: Wen unter deinen Freunden und Mitkadetten respektierst du am meisten?"  
- "Woher kommst du? Ich spüre ein großes Schicksal in dir, das sich nach Erlösung sehnt."  
- "Erzähle mir eine Geschichte aus deiner Vergangenheit. Was sollte ich über dich wissen?"  

Award each character [inspiration](https://5e.tools/book.html#PHB,4,inspiration,0) once they've all answered the questions.

### Stores
_Security Level: Red (Cadet Rank) and Above_

The academy's storerooms contain basic equipment, rations, and an extensive armory. Most academy personnel aren't allowed past the storefront, where quartermaster Mister Blip allocates supplies through a barred window.

Orientation Task: Collect Service Weaponry. 

Upon arrival, each corps cadet is assigned a [simple or martial weapon](https://5e.tools/items.html#blankhash,flstsource:phb=1,flstcategory:basic=1,flsttype:martial%20weapon=1~simple%20weapon=1) of their choice. Cadets can also spend their 50 gp requisition voucher to purchase additional equipment from any of the following sources:

-   The [Armor](https://5e.tools/book.html#phb,5,armor%20and%20shields,0), [Weapons](https://5e.tools/book.html#PHB,5,weapons,0), [Adventuring Gear](https://5e.tools/book.html#PHB,5,adventuring%20gear,0), or [Tools](https://5e.tools/book.html#PHB,5,tools,0) tables in chapter 5 of the [Player's Handbook](https://5e.tools/book.html#PHB)
-   The [Equipment Packs sidebar](https://5e.tools/book.html#PHB,5,equipment%20packs,0) in chapter 5 of the [Player's Handbook](https://5e.tools/book.html#PHB)

No change is given for purchases, so that if a character doesn't spend the full 50 gp, any gold left on their voucher is lost.

[![](https://5e.tools/img/adventure/SjA/007-01-005.o-mister-blip.webp)](https://5e.tools/img/adventure/SjA/007-01-005.o-mister-blip.webp)



Mister Blip (Academy Quartermaster)

_Autognome Quartermaster_

Mister Blip is an odd but well-loved member of Spelljammer Academy. During a ship attack some years ago, the autognome's creator was slain and his memories were lost. With no purpose to speak of, Mister Blip wandered aimlessly, and eventually encountered Boatswain Tarto in her travels. The hadozee invited the autognome to Spelljammer Academy, and he's been there ever since.

Mister Blip is a walking encyclopedia of knowledge on all subjects related to spelljamming. Chances are if you have a question, he's got a dozen different answers for it—and usually doesn't stop opining until asked to be quiet. His quarters are an absolute mess, featuring half a dozen tables piled high with tomes, curiosities, and devices of unknown purpose.

Mister Blip wears a smart-looking leather apron with a score of tools of various purpose tucked into tiny leather loops. The only other article of clothing he wears is a black felt bowler cap. The color of his eyes changes depending on his mood: green if he's feeling inquisitive, blue when determined, red for angry, yellow when excited, and pink if he's proud, among others. A long, smartly crafted bronze mustache completes his ensemble.

**Quote**: "If you're looking for a quick answer, I'm probably not the best place to find it."

## Reporting to Tarto

Once all orientation tasks are complete, the characters can report back to Boatswain Tarto. One character of the players' choosing must deliver a spoken report of their orientation. If they perform well, give this character inspiration.

### The Last Task

After hearing the report, Tarto informs the group that there's one last task they must perform before they're dismissed for lunch. A spelljamming trader has delivered a fresh shipment of supplies to the academy, including a crate addressed to the academy head, Mirt the Merciless—also known as the Old Wolf.

Tarto gives each character a gold security helmet, then orders the characters to deliver the crate to Mirt's room in the Bridge Quarters. She explains that the Old Wolf was up late entertaining visiting dignitaries from the Rock of Bral and is feeling more than a little worse for wear. As such, the characters should keep the noise to a respectable level.

The characters' mission has two directives:

-   Avoid damaging or tampering with the crate in any way.
-   Obey Mirt's orders to the letter.

If the characters carry the crate to Mirt's room, proceed to part 3. The guards at the Bridge quarters nonchalantly wave them past as long as they're wearing the gold security helmets. Once the delivery has been made, the characters can retire for lunch.

Shipping Crate. 

The wooden shipping crate is about two feet on a side and bears a large label that reads "For Mirt." It weighs roughly 100 pounds. One strong character can carry it awkwardly, or two characters can carry it easily.

Unknown to anyone at the academy, the crate secretly contains a number of hungry [neogi hatchlings](https://5e.tools/bestiary.html#neogi%20hatchling_mpmm). If the characters open the crate or otherwise find a way to divine its contents before visiting Mirt's quarters, you'll need to refer to part 3 for guidance. At your determination, the hatchlings can also gnaw their way out of the crate at any time that feels dramatically appropriate.

---

# Part 3: Intruder Alert!

While fulfilling the orders given to them by Boatswain Tarto, the characters meet Mirt the Merciless and discover that someone has sent the head of Spelljammer Academy a most deadly gift.

## Mirt's Quarters

On arrival at the door to Mirt's quarters, the characters hear loud snoring within. (Feel free to give the players your best snoring impression.) Knocking or pushing on the door reveals that it's partly ajar and causes it to creak open. Read or paraphrase the following if the characters peer inside:



Mirt's quarters are sumptuously decorated with velvet curtains, gold fittings, and oak panels. A cauldron-sized fishbowl stands along one wall, filled with squirming octopuses. On the opposite wall, a table bears a topographic map of the Sword Coast. Nearer the door, a walk-in wardrobe stands partly open, golden light spilling out from within.

Peering in, you see the Old Wolf himself, sprawled over a giant, leathery bed—and snoring loudly.

[![Mirt's Quarters](https://5e.tools/img/adventure/SjA/008-01-010.o-mirts-quarters.webp)](https://5e.tools/img/adventure/SjA/008-01-010.o-mirts-quarters.webp "Mirt's Quarters")

Mirt's Quarters

### Fishbowl

The fishbowl contains a number of tiny harmless octopuses. If the bowl is broken (it has AC 5, 2 hit points, and immunity to poison and psychic damage), each creature within 5 feet of the tank is knocked [prone](https://5e.tools/conditionsdiseases.html#prone_phb) and soaked through by the sudden outflow of water.

### Topographic Map

Close inspection of the map on the table reveals that it is set with tiny figurines representing troops. The figurines magically animate whenever a creature moves within 5 feet of the table, playing out a mock battle between giants and dragons. Disturbing the battle is dangerous, though. Anyone who touches the table or a figurine is targeted by tiny catapults (+4 to hit; 3 bludgeoning damage on a hit). After making three such attacks, the catapults run out of ammunition.

### Walk-In Wardrobe

This magical wardrobe ensures that Mirt always looks resplendent for his duties. Any creature that enters the wardrobe is sucked into an extradimensional space and removed from play until start of its next turn, when it emerges from the wardrobe having been treated to a full makeover, featuring fresh makeup and perfume, coiffured hair, and pressed clothes. The process is invigorating, and any creature that undertakes it while injured is restored to full hit points.

### Waterbed

Mirt's leathery bed shifts and rocks, and close inspection reveals that it's filled with water. If the waterbed is damaged (it has AC 5, 3 hit points, and immunity to poison and psychic damage), each creature within 5 feet of it is knocked [prone](https://5e.tools/conditionsdiseases.html#prone_phb) and soaked through by the sudden outflow of water.

## Opening the Crate

When Mirt gets any sense of the characters' presence, he opens a single bloodshot eye and speaks:

"Uuuurgh... by Ilmater's buttocks, mah head is explodin'! If ye've come to drop off that thing, just put it on the rug there, open it as quietly as ye can, and let me die in peace."

At that point, the characters hear a strange thump from within the crate.

If Mirt is asked about the crate, he has no idea who it's from or what's inside. He impatiently demands that the cadets open it up before he regurgitates last night's dinner, which he has no memory of eating.

When the characters open the crate, read or paraphrase the following:



As you open the crate's lid, a cacophony of high-pitched squeals emanates from within. Grotesque creatures scuttle into the light: ugly cat-sized monsters with hairy, spiderlike bodies and eel-like heads. Mirt yelps in shock, tumbles from his bed, and lands heavily on the floor, dragging his bedcovers with him.

### Dealing with the Hatchlings

Four [neogi hatchling Swarm](https://5e.tools/bestiary.html#neogi%20hatchling%20swarm_bam) emerge from hiding inside the crate, positioning themselves around it before combat begins. Each round, the hatchlings attack any characters they can reach. As Tiny creatures, two hatchlings can occupy a single 5-foot space if needed.

Due to his hungover state, Mirt is unlikely to participate in this combat (see "Mirt's Rude Awakening" below). He is a high-level character and won't be at risk here, so no stats are required for him.

[![](https://5e.tools/img/adventure/SjA/009-01-006.o-neogi-hatchlings.webp)](https://5e.tools/img/adventure/SjA/009-01-006.o-neogi-hatchlings.webp)

### Mirt's Rude Awakening

Even on the best of days, Mirt requires a remarkable amount of time to rise from his bed. Though energized by the imminent threat of death, it takes the Old Wolf a full 30 seconds (5 rounds) to mobilize his hungover body. Each turn on initiative count 20 (losing initiative ties), update the players on Mirt's situation using the relevant entry from the table below. If any hatchlings remain alive after 6 rounds, Mirt swiftly skewers them with his rapier and brings the combat to an end.

| Round | Behavior |
| ----- | -------- |
| 1     | Mirt rolls about on the floor, trying to unravel himself from the bedcovers.         |
| 2     | Mirt hops around in his underwear, trying to pull on his breeches.         |
| 3     | Mirt rushes for his belt and rapier, but his breeches slip down on route and send him sprawling.         |
| 4     | Breeches around his ankles, Mirt crawls on all fours for his belt and rapier.         |
| 5     | Mirt pulls on his belt and breeches, with much huffing and puffing.         |
| 6     | Mirt pulls his blade from its scabbard and shouts "Ha!"—then accidentally yanks his belt off in the process, causing his breeches to slip down again.         |

### Aftermath
The sound of battle in Mirt's quarters alerts the guards just as the fight is winding down. As the last hatchlings expire, the characters hear alarms sounding throughout the Bridge Quarters, followed by the thunder of booted feet as security forces converge on Mirt's room.

Mirt is furious! Who dares to try to have him killed? His day is ruined! He swears that heads will roll once he's found out who's behind this outrage. As Mirt is blowing off steam, Mister Blip appears at the door:

It's difficult to tell, but the autognome looks worried. His bronze mustache hangs lower than usual, and his mechanical eyes have sunken in their sockets.

"With regret, Master Mirt, this attack was merely a diversion. While our forces were being drawn here, more burglaries were reported across the academy. Our thief has struck again!"

### Treasure
Once all the excitement has subsided, Mirt breathlessly fishes around in a nearby backpack and draws forth a pouch, from which he digs out a handful of golden ingots. He tosses an ingot (worth 50 gp) to each of the characters with slightly winded thanks, and a murmured plea for their discretion regarding his state before and during the fight.

Mirt the Merciless (Academy Head)
_Human Adventurer (Retired) and Head of Spelljammer Academy_

Mirt was a loudmouthed rogue with a reputation as an adventurer and philanderer. The Old Wolf rose to serve as one of the Masked Lords of Waterdeep and became a close advisor to Laeral Silverhand, the Open Lord of Waterdeep. The extensive wealth he squirreled away as a politician ultimately forced him to flee the city and seek refuge far to the south. Mirt enjoys the finer things in life but remains stout of heart and quick with a sword.

**Quote**: "Toril is an island adrift in a sea of chaos. It must be protected at all costs... ooh, is that cake?"

## Ending the Adventure
With the news that the thief has struck again, this adventure comes to an end. Wrap up by informing the players that their characters are dismissed to their quarters. Any security helmets in their possession must be returned to the guards before the characters leave.

The characters can rest and recuperate before the next stage of their training, as the story continues in the next adventure, _Trial by Fire_.

# Part 2

## Background
Tensions are running high at Spelljammer Academy on the island of Nimbral, thanks to a recent rash of thefts and an attack against the academy's founder, Mirt the Merciless. The academy's instructors have made it clear that it's business as usual for new cadets, though. The characters will be put to the test as they participate in a competitive series of illusory training exercises against another squad of cadets. The characters are to take charge of their own spelljamming ship, plying a magical simulation of Wildspace on a mission to seek out the wreckage of a ship lost in an asteroid cluster. Are they up to the challenge?

## Overview

The adventure's story takes approximately two hours to play and is spread over three parts:

[Part 1: Preflight Meal](https://5e.tools/adventure.html#sja,1,part%201%3a%20preflight%20meal,0). While having breakfast and preparing for their imminent training exercise, the characters meet other cadets and discuss the recent troubling events happening at the academy.

[Part 2: Test of Mettle](https://5e.tools/adventure.html#sja,1,part%202%3a%20test%20of%20mettle,0). Under the supervision of Spelljammer training officer Saerthe Abizin and Spelljammer Corps training officer Boatswain Tarto, the cadets begin a competitive training exercise. Taking on the challenge of crewing their own spelljamming ship will test their skills, bravery, and ability to function as a team.

[Part 3: Sabotage!](https://5e.tools/adventure.html#sja,1,part%203%3a%20sabotage!,0) An agent of an unknown foe sabotages the simulation chamber where the training exercise takes place, causing the equipment there to explode. The characters must help tend to the wounded and might be instrumental in discovering a clue to the identity of the saboteur.

During parts 2 and 3 of the adventure, the characters' actions determine their score—and thus their success or failure—in the training exercise.

## Adventure Hooks

_Trial by Fire_ follows the events of [Orientation](https://5e.tools/adventure.html#SjA,0), the first adventure in the series. Characters who did not participate in the first adventure are assumed to have completed their orientation and are assigned to join the other characters' training team.

# Part 1: Preflight Meal

The adventure begins with the characters gathering in the academy's refectory to eat breakfast with other cadets and discuss recent events at the academy.



Spelljammer Academy

While adventurers of all stripes explore Faerûn and deal with the perils of ancient ruins, malevolent cults, and long-forgotten tombs, those who come through Spelljammer Academy on Nimbral strive to protect the world from far greater threats. Spelljammer Academy trains cadets for service as Spelljammers and members of the Spelljammer Corps: both branches of a magical navy sworn to protect Toril and to explore other worlds beyond. Few people know of the academy's existence, and its leaders try to keep it that way.

Mirt the Merciless—also known as "the Old Wolf"—is Spelljammer Academy's founder and chief financial officer. He manages the institution's operations alongside a small group of powerful high-ranking officers, known collectively as "the Bridge." While most of its candidates are from Toril, the academy occasionally recruits from outside Realmspace (the Wildspace system that is home to the planet Toril) to bring individuals with unique talents into their ranks. Giff, githyanki, hadozee, plasmoids, and myriad other peoples can join the cadets alongside folk native to Toril.

The academy was founded by Mirt as part of a joint investment with the retired elf adventurer Elmandar, who operates a shop on the Rock of Bral—a city built on an asteroid. Prince Andru, the monarch of Bral, has invested heavily in the academy, though his support has waned of late over questions regarding security within the institution.

## Fellowship

To begin the adventure, read or paraphrase the following:



Today is the day! It's the official start of your academy training. Fresh from orientation, you and your crewmates are to report to Saerthe Abizin, the Spelljammer training officer. Before you head out, though, your first stop is the academy refectory for a hearty breakfast.

Found on the Cadet Quarters level, the refectory is a large communal dining hall with a patio. The room is well lit by a dozen blue-glowing orbs attached by bronze-colored rods to the ceiling. An L-shaped counter to the northwest is covered with small tools, contraptions, and alchemical tubes and containers. Behind the counter, a door bears a sign that reads "Staff Only."

### Breakfast of Champions

When the characters arrive, a stocky giff named Petty Officer Winston Ryeback (see the accompanying sidebar) is behind the counter doing what he does best: preparing meals for the academy's hungry cadets. When the characters arrive, the refectory holds a dozen other cadets (a mixture of [acolyte](https://5e.tools/bestiary.html#acolyte_mm), [apprentice wizard](https://5e.tools/bestiary.html#apprentice%20wizard_mpmm), and [bandits](https://5e.tools/bestiary.html#bandit_mm)), all lined up before the counter or seated at tables.

Each character who joins the line receives a bowl containing a smoky concoction of deep-fried meat or beans (the character's choice), held together with sticky starches. Though the galley cook has never given his signature dish a name, most cadets have resorted to calling it "gunpowder chowder."

-   In addition to the characters, another group of cadets are receiving their first training assignment today. There's talk that the training officers might combine the two groups to create a competitive training exercise on the academy's Simulations Deck.
-   The Simulations Deck is a magical marvel equipped with three simulation chambers that magically create the experience of traveling and fighting in Wildspace.
-   Spelljammer Academy has been plagued by a rash of recent thefts, many of them targeting instructors. The thieves have yet to be identified or caught.
-   In addition to Realmspace charts going missing, one of the thefts saw Ryeback's quarters robbed of a custom pistol. The giff loudly voices his frustration around that event if any characters talk about the thefts within earshot of him.
-   More troubling than the thefts is the recent attack on academy founder Mirt the Merciless (which the characters thwarted in the previous adventure). Other cadets suspect the characters' involvement but don't know the details.

[![](https://5e.tools/img/adventure/SjA/013-02-002.o-winston-ryeback.webp)](https://5e.tools/img/adventure/SjA/013-02-002.o-winston-ryeback.webp)



Petty Officer Winston Ryeback

_Giff Galley Cook_

Petty Officer Ryeback (RIE-bak) is a muscular giff in charge of the food served at the Academy (and on the rare occasion, he crews a ship). Like anyone else who runs a respectable galley, he's a staunch believer in the four basic food groups: beans, bacon, whiskey, and lard. He's raucous and brash and gives bear hugs so good you think he might break a rib (but in a good way). His gray skin is usually coated with light sheen of sweat; kitchens are hot!

**Quote**: "The best way to someone's heart is through their stomach."

### Meeting Miken

By the time the characters have picked up their meals, the only table with enough space for all of them is occupied by a cadet named Miken Haverstance (see the accompanying sidebar). Though his head is buried deep in a book, he notices the characters and invites them to sit if they don't do so themselves.

If the characters strike up a conversation with Miken, he expresses anxiety about the upcoming training exercises, having already convinced himself that he doesn't have what it takes to be a recruit. But he's even more afraid of letting down his fellow crewmates. He has been avoiding them to help him keep his focus.

Miken's worst enemy is his own fear. The characters can boost his confidence and lift his spirits in one of the following ways (which might affect their crew's final score at the end of the adventure):

-   Words of Encouragement. A character offering Miken advice to boost his confidence can make a DC 12 Charisma (Persuasion) check. If successful, his spirits are lifted, and you can jump to [part 2](https://5e.tools/adventure.html#sja,1,part%202%3a%20test%20of%20mettle,0) of the adventure.
    
-   Problem Solving. A character asking Miken about his studies kicks off a conversation about spelljamming, taking his mind off his troubles. If that character succeeds on a DC 12 Intelligence (Arcana) check, Miken's spirits are lifted, and you can jump to [part 2](https://5e.tools/adventure.html#sja,1,part%202%3a%20test%20of%20mettle,0) of the adventure.
    
-   Feeling the Vibe. A character who speaks to Miken's crewmates can encourage them to reveal their own insecurities regarding the upcoming training exercises to put Miken's mind at ease. A successful DC 12 Charisma (Persuasion) check persuades the cadets to call Miken over to their table, bolstering his spirits, and you can jump to [part 2](https://5e.tools/adventure.html#sja,1,part%202%3a%20test%20of%20mettle,0) of the adventure.

Miken Haverstance

_Human Cadet_

Miken (MICK-unn) constantly worries about whether he has the right skills to graduate from the Academy. When his nose isn't buried in a technical manual, he's scribbling mathematical and arcane equations in a battered pocket notebook he always keeps on him. Miken has light-olive skin, dark-brown eyes, and short, disheveled black hair framing a round face. He wears the same uniform as the other cadets.

**Quote**: "I'd like to be a great spelljammer, but I don't know if I've got it in me."

---

# Part 2: Test of Mettle

After breakfast, the characters travel to the main hall of Spelljammer Academy's Simulations Deck, where they're briefed on the upcoming training exercise before they're led into one of the adjoining simulation chambers. The exercise will take them on a virtual journey through Wildspace and pit them in a race against the clock, as they must outperform a competing band of cadets facing their own simulation.

Awaiting the characters in the main hall are two officers: Saerthe Abizin (a human), the Spelljammer training officer, and Boatswain Tarto (a hadozee), the Spelljammer Corps training officer. Characters who played through the first _Spelljammer Academy_ adventure met both officers; use the information in the accompanying sidebars to bring new player characters up to speed.

## Mission Briefing

The characters arrive with another squad of six cadets, including Miken Haverstance. Read or paraphrase the following:



You arrive at the Simulations Deck at the same time as another team of cadets, all of you gathering in the main hall where today's training officers—Saerthe Abizin and Boatswain Tarto—stand waiting. A few members of the other squad murmur excitedly, but a glare from Boatswain Tarto as she chews her cigar quiets them.

Saerthe Abizin scans the congregation with silver eyes. Their stern gaze shifts to a wide grin. "Well, this is going to be fun."

Tarto steps forward to welcome the cadets and provide the details of the upcoming training exercise. In addition to testing each cadet's skills and talents, the exercise is also a friendly competition between the two teams of cadets, with each squad earning points that are tracked and recorded by the observing officers.

[![](https://5e.tools/img/adventure/SjA/015-02-004.o-boatswain-tarto.webp)](https://5e.tools/img/adventure/SjA/015-02-004.o-boatswain-tarto.webp)



Boatswain Tarto (Spelljammer Corps Training Officer)

_Hadozee Seasoned Boatswain_

The scars that Boatswain Tarto (pronounced BOE-sun TAR-toe) bears are testament to her status as a battle-hardened veteran. Despite having one of her wing flaps torn away long ago, she remains as capable as ever while on board a ship. Spelljammer Academy has no better person to spearhead the training of raw recruits—and Tarto knows it. Never one to mince words (even when those words are directed toward those who outrank her), this old, grizzled hadozee has light-tan skin and ebon-black fur graying at the temples. She's perpetually shrouded in a thick haze of cigar smoke, the smell of which often signals her imminent arrival.

**Quote**: "Listen to what I tell you; it might just save your life."

### Assigning Roles

Saerthe explains that each team of cadets must assign crew roles to its members. This training exercise has two optional roles (Captain and Shipmate) and one mandatory role (Spelljammer). A team can have multiple Shipmates, but only one Captain and only one Spelljammer.

Try to limit the players' discussion of role assignments to a maximum of 10 minutes. Use the recommendations in the "Know Your Role" sidebar to guide them.

The roles for the training exercise are as follows:

-   Captain (Optional). A team member who assumes this role is expected to give orders to other crew members (who, in turn, are expected to follow those orders).
    
-   Shipmate (Optional). A team member in this role operates the training ship's rigging and shipboard weapons. The ship's Captain can switch to this role as necessary.
    
-   Spelljammer (Mandatory). A team member in this role pilots the training ship using its spelljamming helm. One must be a spellcaster to fill this role.
    



Know Your Role

When choosing role assignments, keeping the following in mind can help characters form an effective spelljamming crew:

-   Using a _spelljamming helm_ requires a keen mind, focus, and magical talent. A character with the ability to cast spells is essential for the Spelljammer role.
-   A crew relies on their captain to be intuitive, sensible, fair-minded, and decisive, making the Captain role a good fit for someone with a high Wisdom or Charisma score.

### The Assignment

After roles are assigned, Saerthe provides the characters with the main objective of the exercise.



After a long pull on her cigar, Boatswain Tarto surveys the assembled crews.

"Each crew is to navigate their ship through a debris field on the outskirts of Coliar, a sodding big gas giant. There, you're to salvage the captain's logbook from the wreckage of an abandoned ship, then return to your starting point with your own ship intact."

Tarto levels a steely eye and says with a glare, "Intact, not first. Get the mission done well; not quick."

If the characters were friendly with Miken in [part 1](https://5e.tools/adventure.html#sja,1,meeting%20miken,0), he wishes them good luck. Both teams then head toward the simulation chambers where their training will take place.

For guidance on scoring the mission, see [appendix A](https://5e.tools/adventure.html#sja,1,appendix%20a%3a%20scoring%20sheet,0).

[![](https://5e.tools/img/adventure/SjA/016-02-005.o-sarthe-abizjn.webp)](https://5e.tools/img/adventure/SjA/016-02-005.o-sarthe-abizjn.webp)



Saerthe Abizjn (Spelljammer Training Officer)

_Human Spelljammer_

Despite their extravagant showboating, Saerthe Abizjn (pronounced SAIR-th ah-bih-ZEEN) remains as mysterious as the isle of Nimbral from which they hail. Although relatively inexperienced in comparison to some of the other instructors at the academy, Saerthe is an experienced spelljammer. Their eyes shimmer like pools of quicksilver, allowing them to see magical auras.

Saerthe's quick wit and sharp tongue provide them with an inexhaustible supply of jabs and quips (though never mean-spirited), accompanied to great effect by their natural talent with illusory magic. Saerthe's white skin is so pale as to be almost translucent, and their blonde hair is worn in a fashionable, immaculately manicured pompadour.

**Quote**: "I make talent look good."

## Simulation Chambers

Each simulation chamber is a broad circular space with a domed ceiling, its stone walls carved with arcane runes that fill the area with bright light. Each chamber is equipped with a training version of a _spelljamming helm_ and creates complex illusions designed to test cadets' speed, skill, and ability to work together in a crisis.

Saerthe Abizin accompanies the characters to a simulation chamber where Mister Blip, the academy's autognome quartermaster, is preparing the physical aspects of the simulation. Mister Blip hurries over when he sees the characters enter, his eyes shifting to a green color as he greets the cadets. The autognome introduces himself to any characters who didn't meet him in the previous _Spelljammer Academy_ adventure. Mister Blip's eyes shift to a bright blue as he hurries over to a table set with magical gear and mysterious devices unrecognizable to the characters, reporting that everything is ready to go.

### Starting the Simulation

Mister Blip hands the characters two pages of parchment: a Wildspace map that shows the route to their destination, and a crude sketch of the logbook they're supposed to retrieve. Saerthe then directs the characters to gather around the training helm atop the platform. Once the characters are in position, read or paraphrase the following:



Saerthe steps back from the platform, holds their palms outward, and begins an incantation. The sigils scrawled along the walls and floors glow brightly, intensifying as the training officer weaves their powerful illusion.

"Good luck, cadets," Saerthe says, "and don't be afraid. Though these illusions are realistic, thanks to my arcane prowess, they are just that—illusions."

Blue-white lines form around you, etching the shape of a ship deck around the platform upon which you stand. The room then melts away amid an explosion of colors, textures, and sounds that place you on the deck of a ship that is shaped like a gigantic hammerhead shark. The ship is situated in the Sky Dock atop Spelljammer Academy. Scudding clouds fill the sky above you.

### Simulator Rules

Each simulation chamber channels powerful illusion magic that adheres to the following rules:

-   Just Like the Real Thing. The simulation around the characters affects all their senses. Everything looks, feels, and sounds real, with the illusion able to create the sense that the characters are in areas whose dimensions are larger than the room. Everything that happens within the illusion should be treated as if the characters are truly where they appear to be.
    
-   Illusory Wards. Characters can't sense that they are in an illusion, nor can the illusion be dispelled. The [detect magic](https://5e.tools/spells.html#detect%20magic_phb) and [dispel magic](https://5e.tools/spells.html#dispel%20magic_phb) spells don't register or disrupt the magic of the illusion, nor of the creatures or objects it creates.
    
-   Damage. Any character who is reduced to 0 hit points by the simulation falls [unconscious](https://5e.tools/conditionsdiseases.html#unconscious_phb) but isn't dying. The character remains [unconscious](https://5e.tools/conditionsdiseases.html#unconscious_phb) until the simulation ends, at which point the character awakens and gains 1 level of [exhaustion](https://5e.tools/conditionsdiseases.html#exhaustion_phb) from lingering psychic shock.
    
-   Restored Resources. When the simulation ends, characters regain all their lost hit points, spell slots, and limited-use powers.
    

### Taking Off

Once the illusion begins, the crew must take off and ascend into Wildspace. This requires the character in the Spelljammer role to succeed on a DC 13 ability check using their spellcasting ability. If the check succeeds, the character uses the _spelljamming helm_ to propel the ship skyward. If the character succeeds on the check on the first try, it counts toward the group's score in the training exercise (see [appendix A](https://5e.tools/adventure.html#sja,1,appendix%20a%3a%20scoring%20sheet,0)). A second attempt at the check succeeds automatically.



The island of Nimbral disappears quickly beneath your ship, which passes through clouds until the spectacular void of Wildspace comes into view.

[![](https://5e.tools/img/adventure/SjA/017-02-006.o-mister-blip.webp)](https://5e.tools/img/adventure/SjA/017-02-006.o-mister-blip.webp)



Mister Blip (Academy Quartermaster)

_Autognome Quartermaster_

Mister Blip is an odd but well-loved member of Spelljammer Academy. During a ship attack some years ago, the autognome's creator was slain and his memories were lost. With no purpose to speak of, Mister Blip wandered aimlessly, and eventually encountered Boatswain Tarto in her travels. The hadozee invited the autognome to Spelljammer Academy, and he's been there ever since.

Mister Blip is a walking encyclopedia of knowledge on all subjects related to spelljamming. Chances are if you have a question, he's got a dozen different answers for it—and usually doesn't stop opining until asked to be quiet. His quarters are an absolute mess, featuring half a dozen tables piled high with tomes, curiosities, and devices of unknown purpose.

Mister Blip wears a smart-looking leather apron with a score of tools of various purpose tucked into tiny leather loops. The only other article of clothing he wears is a black felt bowler cap. The color of his eyes changes depending on his mood: green if he's feeling inquisitive, blue when determined, red for angry, yellow when excited, and pink if he's proud, among others. A long, smartly crafted bronze mustache completes his ensemble.

**Quote**: "If you're looking for a quick answer, I'm probably not the best place to find it."

## Journey through Wildspace

During their simulated journey, the characters must overcome the challenges described below. A challenge is resolved by having each character make an ability check. If half or more of the characters succeed on the check, the challenge is overcome. Otherwise, the characters fail their initial attempt, and their score is impacted (see [appendix A](https://5e.tools/adventure.html#sja,1,appendix%20a%3a%20scoring%20sheet,0)), but any follow-up attempt succeeds automatically, allowing the training exercise (and the journey) to continue.

#### Challenge 1: Plotting a Course



The characters must use their Wildspace map to plot a course to their destination. Have each character make a DC 12 ability check. Each player chooses which check to make based on their character's role aboard the ship:

**Captain**: Wisdom (Survival) or Charisma (Persuasion)

**Shipmate**: Strength (Athletics) or Dexterity (Acrobatics)

**Spelljammer**: Intelligence (Investigation) or Wisdom (Survival)

#### Challenge 2: Electrical Storm



The characters' ship accelerates to spelljamming speed, racing through Wildspace toward its destination. After a minute or so in this simulated state, the ship returns to its normal flying speed. A school of giant space eels swims past the ship, and each eel discharges a bolt of lightning as it zips by. The ship is caught in the eels' electrical storm, which starts one or more fires on the deck.

Avoiding the worst of the electrical storm and extinguishing the flames requires each character to make a DC 13 ability check. Each player chooses which check to make based on their character's role aboard the ship:

**Captain**: Wisdom (Survival) or Charisma (Persuasion)

**Shipmate**: Strength (Athletics) or Dexterity (Acrobatics)

**Spelljammer**: Intelligence (Arcana) or Wisdom (Survival)

#### Challenge 3: Asteroid Cluster



Once the space eels are a safe distance away, the ship can resume its journey, traveling rapidly at spelljamming speed. After another minute in this simulated state, the ship arrives at its destination, where the characters discover that the abandoned ship they seek is located at the center of a cluster of asteroids. Reaching the ship safely means navigating a careful route through the asteroids.

Have each character make a DC 13 ability check. Each player chooses which check to make based on their character's role aboard the ship:

**Captain**: Wisdom (Survival) or Charisma (Persuasion)

**Shipmate**: Strength (Athletics) or Dexterity (Acrobatics)

**Spelljammer**: Intelligence (Arcana) or Wisdom (Perception)

If the characters fail their initial attempt to avoid the asteroids, the ship is lightly damaged as it grazes an asteroid. This damage becomes relevant later (see "[Wildspace Battle](https://5e.tools/adventure.html#sja,1,wildspace%20battle,0)" below).

## Salvage Operation

Once their ship passes through the asteroid cluster, the characters reach the wreckage of a flying fish ship, torn apart by the celestial debris. The longer the characters take to locate and claim the captain's logbook, the more difficult the task becomes. Initiative rolls aren't necessary but track how many rounds of ability checks it takes for the characters to spot the derelict ship's logbook.

### Spotting the Logbook

The wreckage is surrounded by a cloud of silvery dust particles that reduce visibility. After pulling alongside the wreck, characters searching for the logbook must make a DC 16 Wisdom (Perception) check, spotting it if successful. The logbook lays amid debris from the captain's cabin, all of which bobs in the derelict's gravity plane. The characters repeat this check each round until the logbook is spotted.

### Retrieving the Logbook

The next, more difficult task is obtaining the book. While the debris rests in the ship's gravity plane, it's not exactly solid ground, and disturbing it could make finding the log difficult. This is a great opportunity for the players' ingenuity and creativity to shine. Let them come up with their own way of solving the problem, whether it's using [mage hand](https://5e.tools/spells.html#mage%20hand_phb), tying a rope around a character's waist and leaping out toward the logbook, or other similar efforts—assigning a DC 13 check using an ability and skill that you deem appropriate. If successful, they are able to retrieve the logbook.

### Leaving the Asteroid Cluster

Once the logbook is safely on board, the characters can exit the asteroid cluster. Once again, the characters must avoid the asteroids by repeating challenge 3 from the "[Journey through Wildspace](https://5e.tools/adventure.html#sja,1,challenge%203%3a%20asteroid%20cluster,0)" section; if the ship was lightly damaged by an asteroid earlier and grazes another asteroid on its way out of the cluster, the ship becomes heavily damaged instead.

## Wildspace Battle

[![](https://5e.tools/img/adventure/SjA/018-02-007.o-swashbuckling-splash.webp)](https://5e.tools/img/adventure/SjA/018-02-007.o-swashbuckling-splash.webp)



As your ship steers clear of the asteroids, another ship appears. Its sleek frame is painted in a wild shade of pink and is designed to resemble an immense squid. Starlight reflects off the ship's hull—illuminating two turret-mounted ballistas rotating slowly to face your ship.

The attacking ship is an old, but reliable, squid ship crewed by githyanki pirates. Having already set their sights on salvaging the derelict, the githyanki don't take kindly to the characters jumping their claim. The githyanki ship immediately moves into attack position, forcing the characters into battle.

### Hammerhead Ship

The following statistics are for the characters' training ship and appear in [handout 1](https://5e.tools/adventure.html#sja,1,handout%201%3a%20hammerhead%20ship,0). The ship is equipped with one ballista and two mangonels, each on a rotating mount. The front of the ship also acts as a devastating ram. Provide the players with that handout for easy reference.

Hammerhead Ship Summary

Armor Class 15 (wood)

Cargo: 30 tons

Hit Points: 400

Crew: 15

Damage Threshold: 15

Keel/Beam: 250 ft./25 ft.

Speed: Fly 35 ft. (4 mph)

Cost: 40,000 gp

-   Hit Points. If the ship was lightly damaged in the "[Journey through Wildspace](https://5e.tools/adventure.html#sja,1,journey%20through%20wildspace,0)" section, it has 300 hit points instead. If the ship was heavily damaged in the "Salvage Operation" section, it has 220 hit points instead.
    

### Squid Ship

The following statistics are for the attacking githyanki pirate ship and appear in [appendix B](https://5e.tools/adventure.html#sja,1,appendix%20b%3a%20squid%20ship,0). The ship is equipped with two ballista and a mangonel, each on a rotating mount. The tentacles at the ship's bow also act as a piercing ram.

Squid Ship Summary

Armor Class 15 (wood)

Cargo: 20 tons

Hit Points: 300

Crew: 13

Damage Threshold: 15

Keel/Beam: 250 ft./25 ft.

Speed: Fly 30 ft. (3½ mph)

Cost: 25,000 gp

### Using Roles in Combat

During each round of combat, a ship has its own turn and the members of its crew resolve its actions. Actions available to each crew member are dependent upon their assigned roles.

## Running the Encounter

Use the following guidance for running and resolving the encounter between the characters' hammerhead and the githyanki ship.

### The Battle Begins

Using the side initiative variant rules from [chapter 9](https://5e.tools/book.html#DMG,9,side%20initiative,0) of the [Dungeon Master's Guide](https://5e.tools/book.html#DMG), the players roll a d20 for their initiative as a group, and you roll a d20 for the githyanki aboard the enemy ship. Neither roll takes any modifiers.

The githyanki ship is 50 feet away from the hammerhead ship and maintains its distance throughout this encounter, attempting to disable the characters' ship before the githyanki attempt to board it. While the hammerhead ship is faster than the githyanki ship, the characters will still be in range of its weapons if they choose to flee.

### Evil Shadows

Two [shadows](https://5e.tools/bestiary.html#shadow_mm)—former crew members of the flying fish ship that lie strewn amid the asteroids—are attracted to the battle as it unfolds. At the start of the fourth round of combat, they appear at the stern of the characters' ship and attack the nearest creatures. Roll a d20 for the shadows' initiative, again with no modifier.

### Alternative Scenarios

Some characters might want to resort to options other than direct ship-to-ship combat when the githyanki ship attacks, with a few examples discussed below. Use your best judgment when adjudicating these tactics, and reward players for great ideas and quick thinking.

Using Magic. 

Certain spells can be used to damage an enemy ship or hamper its crew. A ship's spelljamming helm or pilot often can't be targeted without being aboard the enemy ship.

Boarding. 

The characters can board the ship instead of fighting it at a distance. Any such attempt requires the pilot to move the character's ship within 5 feet of the enemy ship.

Once one or more characters board the githyanki ship, that ship makes only one ballista attack each round. The rest of the crew—six to eight githyanki pirates using the[Pirate first Mate](https://5e.tools/bestiary.html#pirate%20first%20mate_gos) stat block, but which are resistant to psychic damage—leave their stations to defend the ship, taking the characters on in combat. See [appendix C](https://5e.tools/adventure.html#sja,1,appendix%20c%3a%20squid%20ship%20map,0) for the squid ship's layout.

## Ending the Encounter

The encounter ends when one of the following conditions is met:

-   The enemy ship is reduced to 100 hit points or fewer, causing it to retreat.
-   The enemy ship takes two critical hits, causing it to retreat.
-   The characters' ship moves more than 100 feet away from the enemy ship, at which point the enemy ship breaks off its pursuit and flees.
-   The characters' ship is reduced to 0 hit points. If this occurs, the characters fail the training exercise, and the simulation ends.

## Help!

Provided the characters don't lose their ship in the training exercise, they can make their return journey once their ship-to-ship battle ends:



Your ship slows, marking the unexpected presence of something else in the vicinity. It takes just a moment to spot another hammerhead ship in the distance. The other ship is severely damaged and adrift. Every few seconds, bands of electricity ripple out from the center of its hull, dealing further damage to the ship.

If the characters approach the other hammerhead ship, they spot the cadets from the other team on its deck. No check is needed to tell they're in trouble. Miken is among them and waves for help.

The characters can choose to leave the other team to their fate with the goal of beating them to the finish line, or they can approach the other ship and evacuate its crew before that ship is destroyed.

After the characters abandon or evacuate their fellow cadets, the simulation ends. Continue with part 3.

# Part 3: Sabotage!

The simulation chambers at Spelljammer Academy have been sabotaged, causing Saerthe's illusions to erupt with a backlash of energy. This backlash caused the _spelljamming helm_aboard Miken's simulated hammerhead ship to malfunction at the end of part 2.

The characters won't learn the full story in this adventure, but the sabotage is related to the recent rash of thefts at the academy and the attack on Mirt. The saboteurs' targets are the academy's instructors—but cadets are prone to get caught in the crossfire.

## Shattering Illusions

Read or paraphrase the following to start this final encounter:



The illusion around you ends in a wave of silvery blue light, and you stand within the simulation chamber where your training exercise began. Magical energy ripples like a turbulent cloud around you, reaching out to touch the rune-scribed walls, then exploding outward as bolts of lightning, sending Saerthe, Tarto, and others flying to the ground.

Each character must make a DC 13 Dexterity saving throw, taking 13 (3d8) lightning damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.

### Picking Up the Pieces

Most of the magical backlash caused by the sabotage was directed at Saerthe Abizin and Boatswain Tarto, where the two were supervising the training exercises. Both are badly injured.

In addition to tending to their own wounds, the characters can head to the other simulation chamber where Miken's group of cadets was being tested. If the characters spoke with and encouraged Miken in [part 1](https://5e.tools/adventure.html#sja,1,meeting%20miken,0), or if they inspired Miken's fellow cadets to open up to them, they discover that Miken's actions saved his fellow teammates from the worst of the magical backlash. If the characters were unsuccessful in their overtures or made no effort to interact with Miken or his fellow cadets, two of those cadets are critically wounded. Unless they receive magical healing, they die in three rounds. Alternatively, a character who succeeds on a DC 13 Wisdom (Medicine) check is able to stabilize them—provided they do so within three rounds.

### Finding Clues

Characters can help the training officers examine the simulation chambers for signs of sabotage. A character who succeeds on a DC 12 Intelligence (Investigation) or Wisdom (Perception) check notices an odd-shaped metallic plate crudely jammed into the walls of one of the chambers. A search of the other chamber reveals an identical object, with each bearing a jagged sigil carved into it. A [detect magic](https://5e.tools/spells.html#detect%20magic_phb) spell reveals powerful magic emanating from both objects. (If the characters don't find either plate, Mister Blip discovers one of them.)

Once Saerthe Abizin or Boatswain Tarto are informed, they examine the plate and deduce it to be the cause of the sabotage. In addition, examination of the sigil reveals something to the officers, which the characters can overhear:



Boatswain Tarto scowls, chomping down on her cigar. She points to the sigil as she looks to Saerthe Abizin.

"That look familiar to you?"

Saerthe's quicksilver eyes scan the object coldly. "Vocath. I should have suspected. It appears that the mercane's grudge against Mirt has become a vendetta. The Old Wolf must be told."

If any characters ask about Vocath, both officers crisply inform them that the matter is none of their business. (The characters will have a chance to learn more in subsequent adventures.)

## Ending the Adventure

Although the training exercises were sabotaged, all the cadets completed enough of the session to receive their scores. The characters earn points in the training exercise as outlined in [appendix A](https://5e.tools/adventure.html#sja,1,appendix%20a%3a%20scoring%20sheet,0).

If the characters earn 6 points or more, they successfully complete the exercise. For winning the competition against the other squad, each character is awarded 100 gp.

If the characters earn fewer than 6 points, they fail the training exercise. Boatswain Tarto commends them for their efforts regardless (especially if they stopped to help the other squad even in their failed effort) and tells them they'll have a chance to repeat the exercise. (Unknown to the characters, though, the urgent mission presented in the next adventure will take priority.)
